## Framework Structure

### Theoretical Foundations

#### Morphonic Field Theory


**Core Concepts:**

- E8 lattice geometry as fundamental structure
- Morphonic tension Φ(x) = x^T A x
- Quadratic invariance: ΔΦ ≤ 0 constraint
- Toroidal time structures
- Boundary-only entropy
- Morphons as emergent photonic eigenstates


**Mathematical Framework:**

- Cartan-Weyl classification
- E8 root system (240 roots)
- Weyl chamber projections
- Hodge decomposition for boundary entropy
- Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) for compliance signatures


#### The Four Laws of CQE


**Law 1 Quadratic Invariance**

- **Principle:** Internal state evolution forbids ΔΦ > 0
- **Meaning:** No harm injection inside coherent regions
- **Enforcement:** MorphonicField.apply_internal_step() validation

**Law 2 Boundary Only Entropy**

- **Principle:** Irreversible acts must be boundary crossings
- **Meaning:** No silent damage bleeding inside regions
- **Enforcement:** Channel 9 classification + BoundaryReceipt logging

**Law 3 Auditable Governance**

- **Principle:** Every boundary event produces cryptographic receipt
- **Meaning:** No 'just trust me' politics
- **Enforcement:** Canonical Normal Form (CNF) + AuditChain

**Law 4 Optimized Efficiency**
