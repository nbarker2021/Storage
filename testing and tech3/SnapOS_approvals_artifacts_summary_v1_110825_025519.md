# Approvals → Artifacts Concordance (Proximity Heuristic)
**Generated:** 2025-08-11T02:55:19.742121-07:00
- Approvals detected: 0 (rows may repeat approvals when multiple nearby artifacts)
- Window: ±10 events; assistant events with file tokens or delivery verbs are considered artifacts.

## Notes
- This is Phase-1 heuristic linking. Phase-2 can use stricter rules (e.g., only link if artifact name echoes request wording).
