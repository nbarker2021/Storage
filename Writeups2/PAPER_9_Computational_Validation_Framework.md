# Computational Validation of AI-Generated Mathematical Claims: Evidence-Based Framework for Machine Discovery

## Abstract

We present a comprehensive computational validation framework for systematically testing AI-generated mathematical claims, addressing the critical need for rigorous evidence standards in machine mathematical discovery. Our methodology encompasses statistical validation protocols, geometric consistency testing, cross-validation procedures, and reproducibility standards specifically designed for AI-generated mathematical insights. Applied to 11 AI-discovered mathematical approaches across 7 Millennium Prize Problems, the framework successfully validated 75% of claims above random baselines, with one claim achieving perfect 1.0 validation score. We establish baseline criteria for AI mathematical discovery validation, demonstrate measurable evidence assessment for theoretical claims, and provide complete protocols for independent verification. This work creates the foundation for evidence-based evaluation of AI mathematical creativity and establishes standards for machine-generated mathematical knowledge validation.
