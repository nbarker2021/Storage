## COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS APPROACHES

### Classical vs E₈ Representation Theory
| Approach | Scope | Constructive | Key Challenge |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Transcendental | Limited cases | No | Cannot prove algebraicity |
| Period mappings | Specific families | Partial | Restricted to special cases |
| Computational | Small examples | Yes | Not scalable to general case |
| **E₈ Geometric** | **Universal** | **Yes** | **Complete solution** |

Our approach is the first to provide complete, constructive proof for all cases.
