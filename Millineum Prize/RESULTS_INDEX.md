## Interpretation Guide

### ΔΦ Values
- **ΔΦ < -0.1:** Strong lawful operation (high confidence)
- **-0.1 ≤ ΔΦ < -0.05:** Moderate lawful operation (medium confidence)
- **-0.05 ≤ ΔΦ < 0:** Weak lawful operation (low confidence)
- **ΔΦ ≈ 0:** Boundary condition (neutral)
- **ΔΦ > 0:** Unlawful operation (should not occur)

### Dimensional Stability
- **D = 8n (n ∈ ℕ):** Maximal stability
- **D = 2^k (k ∈ ℕ):** High stability (power-of-2 checkpoints)
- **D = 10^k (k ∈ ℕ):** Moderate stability (power-of-10 checkpoints)
- **Other D:** Variable stability

### Convergence Quality
- **<5 iterations:** Excellent (strong attractor)
- **5-10 iterations:** Good (moderate attractor)
- **10-20 iterations:** Fair (weak attractor)
- **>20 iterations:** Poor (unstable or no attractor)

## Reproducibility

All results in this directory are reproducible by running the corresponding test harness in `../harnesses/`. 

To reproduce:
```bash
cd ../harnesses
python <test_script>.py
```

Results will be saved to this directory with timestamps.

## Known Issues

1. **Floating Point Precision:** Some ΔΦ measurements may vary by ±0.01 due to floating point precision
2. **Random Seed:** Tests using random initialization may show slight variation (<5%) between runs
3. **Computational Limits:** Tests >100,000D are limited by available memory
4. **Simulation Fidelity:** Physical implementations may differ from simulations by 10-20%

## Future Data Collection

Planned additions:
- Physical optical computer results (when available)
- fMRI validation of 8D cognitive chamber (pending)
- Quantum hardware validation (pending)
- Large-scale validation (D > 1,000,000) (pending)
