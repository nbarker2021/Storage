# Expanded and Integrated Document for Buckets 1–4

This document integrates and expands **Buckets 1–4** (Base Structures, Digits & Operators, Rests & Windows, and Gates & Symmetries), along with the refinement documents already produced. The goal is to present a cohesive, deeply interlinked picture of how the algebraic and structural components connect into one framework.

---

## **Bucket 1 — Base Structures (Foundations)**

### Definition
- **Primitive space**: ℤ^D with D a multiple of 8 (default D=80 = E8×10).
- **Quadratic form**: Q(v) = vᵀ G v with block-diagonal Cartan matrix of E8.
- **Base embedding**: primarily base-4 and base-8 (organizational logic), expanded into dual relations with base-10, base-16, and validated externally by base-24.

### Core Roles
1. Provides the **skeleton geometry** (80D) where moves are lifted.
2. Defines **lawful operations** (fold/split/shear) consistent with quadratic invariants.
3. Establishes the **embedding machine**: base-4 parity anchors ↔ base-8 dual organization, expanded by higher base overlays.

### Connections
- Connects to **Bucket 2 (digits)** because digits 1–8 are operators that define lawful moves in this space.
- Connects to **Bucket 3 (rests)** because every base operation must close on a valid rest.
- Connects to **Bucket 4 (gates)** since legality of transitions is verified via PAL/MIRROR symmetries.

## **Bucket 2 — Digits as Operators**

### Defined Roles of 1–8
- **1 = Primitive force**: initiator, anchor, or AMP repair tick. Always mobile.
- **2 = Dual lane**: pairing, mirroring, CRT duality; golden ratio modulation towards a triad.
- **3 = Triad stabilizer**: Σv ≡ 0 mod 9, expansion-seeking, enables braid formation.
- **4 = Rest parity**: Σv ≡ 0 mod 4. First lawful anchor where entropy reconciles.
- **5 = Primitive braids**: full braid realization from triadic sources (3×3×3 sets).
- **6 = Triad resting**: 2+2+2 structure; stability before outward exploration.
- **7 = Isotropy/odd-prime gate**: Q(v) ≡ 0 mod 7; regulates reentry and composite fractals.
- **8 = Octadic rest**: duality-forced stable rest; Σv ≡ 0 mod 8 and Q(v) ≡ 0 mod 4.

### Derived Meta-Claim
- **Odd digits (1,3,5,7)**: trend toward action, expansion, entropy release.
- **Even digits (2,4,6,8)**: trend toward organization, stabilization, reconciliation.
- Digits not only operate sequentially but also describe the **roadmap of prior moves** when read as linked logic states.

### Connections
- Digits force movements through **rests (Bucket 3)** and ensure transitions must be mirrored/palindromic at key stages (**gates, Bucket 4**).
- The “meta law”: **1 forces 2, and 2 forces 3** → cascade anchoring and triad formation, closing at 4.

## **Bucket 3 — Rests & Windows (Anchors)**

### Defined Windows
- **W4**: Σv ≡ 0 mod 4 (primitive parity anchor).
- **W80**: Σv ≡ 0 mod 8 and Q(v) ≡ 0 mod 4.
  - *Global mode*: single quadratic check.
  - *Strict mode*: per 8-block E8 check.
- **7/72 Expansion**: isotropy mod 7 + triadic neutrality mod 9.
- **φ-lane 11/40 Expansion**: isotropy mod 11 + neutrality mod 10.

### Functional Roles
1. Provide **catch/cache channels**: filtering entropic waste for future embedding.
2. Force closure at checkpoints, ensuring ΔS ≥ 0 monotone reconciliation.
3. Establish lawful step patterns: **3, 5, 8 as braid-forming checkpoints.**

### Connections
- Rests connect directly with **Digits (Bucket 2)**:
  - 1–2–3 sequence naturally pushes toward W4 closure.
  - 3 triggers expansion (7/72), 5 forces braids, 8 closes at W80.
- **Buckets 1 & 4**: rests anchor the skeleton geometry and interact with gates to validate transitions.

## **Bucket 4 — Gates & Symmetries**

### Defined Gates
- **PAL_b**: window is palindromic in base b → ensures free embedding once halfway point is validated.
- **MIRROR(m,b)**: number ≡ reverse mod m in base b.
- **Mirror-CRT**: combine multiple MIRROR congruences using CRT → glue for superpermutation overlaps.

### Functional Roles
1. Act as **prefilters** before rests: block garbage, pass symmetry-rich sequences.
2. PAL specifically grants “free embedding” mid-solve: once mirror point reached, reverse half is guaranteed.
3. Ensure **local legality** before expensive reconciliation.

### Connections
- PAL/MIRROR are direct incarnations of **superpermutation overlap reuse** (Unified system link).
- Tie to **Digits (Bucket 2)**: digit 2 = dual/mirror lane; digit 3 = triadic expansions; digit 1 = rest tick.
- Tie to **Rests (Bucket 3)**: only windows passing gates may reach or re-enter lawful rests.

## **Integrated Picture (Buckets 1–4)**

1. **Space (Bucket 1)** provides the embedding skeleton.
2. **Digits (Bucket 2)** are operators that act as micro-instructions in that space.
3. **Rests (Bucket 3)** are checkpoints ensuring entropy reconciliation and lawful closure.
4. **Gates (Bucket 4)** prefilter and compress transitions via symmetry, reducing entropy cost.

**Meta Claim**:
- The system is a **base-4/base-8 embedding machine**, which enumerates lawful state progressions by forcing digits 1–8 into braid-capable routes.
- Palindromes and mirrors serve as **free embedding shortcuts**, triads as stabilizers, and rests as reconciliation points.
- The system evolves by alternating between expansion (odd digits) and organization (even digits), closing loops at lawful rests.

## **Open Questions in Buckets 1–4**

1. Are 5-braids **always** 5 units of 3 (3×3×3 triads) rather than 3 sets of 3?
2. Does PAL’s “free embedding” introduce hidden entropic bias we need to track explicitly?
3. How do base-24 governance layers (Bucket 6 forward) validate the base-8 dualities globally?
4. Can we formally map digits 1–8 onto known algebraic operators (Pauli group, modular forms, Ramanujan theta functions)?

---

## **Testing Framework (Buckets 1–4)**

1. **Digit legality tests**: simulate 1–8 strings, verify W4/W80/7/72 closures.
2. **Palindrome advantage test**: compare entropy usage of PAL vs non-PAL sequences.
3. **Braid resolution test**: count braids formed at digits 3, 5, 8, log ΔS and Crooks ratios.
4. **Base-integration test**: trial embeddings of base-4/base-8 sequences into base-10/base-16, measure re-entry legality at base-24.
