Four Fundamental Forces of Nature
This report surveys gravity, electromagnetism, the weak force, and the strong force. Each section contrasts the classical and quantum descriptions, identifies the mediating particle(s), and explains energy/momentum/information transfer and observable effects.
Gravity
• Classical (Newton): In Newton’s theory, every two masses attract with force $F=G,m_1m_2/r^2$. This “action-at-a-distance” force explains planetary orbits and tides. Gravitational potential energy and momentum are well defined in this limit.
• General Relativity (Einstein): Einstein showed gravity is not a force but arises from curvature of spacetime by mass-energy. “Gravity is treated as a geometric phenomenon that arises from the curvature of spacetime”. Objects follow geodesics; this explains Mercury’s perihelion advance, light bending (gravitational lensing), time dilation in gravitational fields, and gravitational waves. GR is a classical field theory with the stress–energy tensor as source and fully verified by experiment.
• Quantum Gravity (tentative): A quantum theory of gravity remains unsolved. Hypothetically gravity is mediated by the graviton, a massless spin-2 quantum of the gravitational field. In string theory one vibrational mode of a string corresponds to the graviton. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) predicts a quantized spacetime: area and volume operators have discrete spectra, suggesting “space itself has a discrete nature” at the Planck scale. However, no complete, tested theory yet exists.
• Energy, Momentum, Information: Gravity carries energy and momentum via its field (e.g. gravitational waves carry energy flux). Information in gravitational systems leads to deep puzzles: black holes appear to hide information. Bekenstein argued black hole entropy $S_{\rm BH}\propto A$ (horizon area), with $S_{\rm BH}=k_B A/4L_p^2$. This area–entropy relation implies a holographic principle: the information content of a volume can be encoded on its boundary. Hawking radiation from black holes creates an information paradox (if the hole evaporates completely, where did the information go?). Resolving this paradox is an active area of research, linking gravity to quantum information theory.
• Observables/Constraints: Classical tests (orbits, tides), relativistic tests (light deflection, time dilation, GW detection) are well established. At very short scales, quantum gravity effects are speculative, with constraints coming only from thought experiments (e.g. BH entropy) or indirect consistency checks.
Electromagnetism
• Classical (Maxwell/Lorentz): Electromagnetism is governed by Maxwell’s equations, which unify electric field E and magnetic field B. Maxwell’s four equations (“div E=ρ/ε₀, div B=0, curl E=−∂B/∂t, curl B=μ₀J+μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t”) fully describe how charges and currents produce fields. A charged particle of charge q in fields experiences the Lorentz force ${\bf F}=q({\bf E}+{\bf v}\times{\bf B})$. Together these describe classical phenomena from electrostatics to electromagnetic waves.
Charged particles in magnetic and electric fields (cyclotron motion). Electrons emitted by a cathode are deflected into circular orbits by a magnetic field (image from a cyclotron experiment). This illustrates the Lorentz force ${\bf F}=q({\bf E}+{\bf v}\times{\bf B})$ acting on moving charges.
• Quantum (QED): In quantum electrodynamics, the electromagnetic field is quantized. The photon is the gauge boson of the U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism. Photons are massless and come in two polarization states (spin-1 particles). Virtual photons mediate the electromagnetic force between charges in Feynman diagrams. QED accounts for quantum phenomena like the photoelectric effect, Lamb shift, and radiative corrections. Gauge symmetry implies charge conservation and a long-range force (massless photon).
• Energy/Momentum/Information Transfer: Electromagnetic fields carry energy and momentum: the Poynting vector ${\bf S}=\frac{1}{\mu_0}{\bf E}\times{\bf B}$ gives energy flux and momentum density. EM waves propagate at speed $c$ (the ultimate speed limit for information and energy transfer). Classical EM underlies all classical communication (radio, light signals) subject to bandwidth (Shannon limits) and light-speed constraints. Photons carry quantum information as well (e.g. in quantum optics).
• Observable Constraints: Electromagnetism is extremely well tested. It governs everyday phenomena (electric circuits, light, magnetism) and atomic structure. The finite propagation speed $c$ enforces causality. Nonlinear effects appear only in extreme fields (quantum regimes). The small coupling (fine-structure constant ≈1/137) makes QED the most precisely tested quantum field theory.
Weak Nuclear Force
• Fermi’s Theory (β-decay): Historically, Enrico Fermi modeled beta decay (neutron→proton+electron+antineutrino) by a point-like four-fermion interaction. This effective theory treated neutron and proton as two states of one particle and introduced an interaction Hamiltonian allowing $n\to p+e^-+\bar\nu_e$. In modern terms, this is understood as low-energy virtual W⁻-boson exchange. Fermi’s theory successfully described β spectra but violated unitarity at high energies (necessitating a more complete theory).
• Electroweak Unification: The weak force is now unified with electromagnetism as the SU(2)×U(1) gauge theory of Glashow–Weinberg–Salam. There are three massive gauge bosons: W⁺, W⁻ (charged) and Z⁰ (neutral). The W bosons carry electric charge and mediate charged-current processes (changing quark/lepton flavor), while the Z boson mediates neutral-current (no charge exchange) weak interactions. For example, in neutron β⁻ decay a down quark emits a W⁻ and becomes an up quark (so $d\to u+W^-$); the W⁻ then decays to $e^-+\bar\nu_e$. “The W and Z bosons carry the weak interaction”. The electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism: three of the SU(2)×U(1) gauge fields acquire mass (giving massive W/Z), leaving the photon massless. The weak boson masses (80–90 GeV) make the force very short-ranged ($10^{-18}$ m).
Feynman diagram of neutron β⁻ decay: a down quark converts to an up quark by emitting a W⁻ boson (not shown); the W⁻ then produces an electron and antineutrino. This illustrates how the weak force changes quark “flavor” (down→up) via W-boson exchange.
• Energy/Momentum/Information: Weak interactions do not bind macroscopic bodies; they change internal particle types. They release kinetic energy (e.g. in β-decay) and produce neutrinos that carry away energy and entropy. Parity violation and CP violation in weak processes have implications for fundamental symmetries and may relate to the matter–antimatter asymmetry. The weak force is much weaker than EM at low energy, but comparable at very high energies (electroweak unification).
• Observable Effects: The weak interaction is responsible for nuclear β-decay and processes in the Sun (proton–proton fusion), particle decays (kaons, pions), and neutrino scattering. It violates parity maximally. Entropically, weak decays increase the number of particles (e.g. n→p+e+ν), raising entropy and degrading energy. Precision tests of the electroweak theory (LEP, LHC) have confirmed W/Z properties and gauge couplings to high accuracy.
Strong Nuclear Force
• Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): The strong force binds quarks into hadrons and protons/neutrons into nuclei. QCD is a non-Abelian SU(3) gauge theory: quarks carry a “color” charge (three types: red/green/blue) and interact by exchanging 8 types of gluons. Gluons are the gauge bosons of the strong force, analogous to the photon in EM. The color field has self-interactions (gluons carry color), making the theory nonlinear. Quarks and gluons have never been observed in isolation due to confinement.
• Confinement and Asymptotic Freedom: At large distances (low energy) the strong coupling grows, so quarks are confined inside hadrons. As a result, attempts to separate quarks create new quark–antiquark pairs rather than isolating single quarks. Conversely, at short distances (high momentum transfer) the coupling weakens — this is asymptotic freedom, for which Gross, Wilczek and Politzer won the Nobel Prize. Thus quarks behave as nearly free particles in high-energy collisions but are bound at low energies.
• Hadron Structure: Protons and neutrons (nucleons) are bound states of three quarks (baryons) held together by gluon exchange; mesons are quark–antiquark pairs. The “residual” strong force (via pion exchange) binds nucleons in nuclei. Gluons and quarks inside hadrons carry significant kinetic and potential energy, explaining most of the hadron’s mass (chiral symmetry breaking).
• Energy/Momentum/Entropy: The strong force is extremely strong at femtometer scales, dominating nuclear binding energy. In heavy-ion collisions or the early universe, matter becomes a quark–gluon plasma: a high-entropy soup of deconfined quarks and gluons. As the plasma cools, confinement generates a vast number of hadrons, increasing entropy. In neutron stars, dense nuclear matter entropy affects pressure support and cooling.
• Observable Phenomena: Confinement means only color-neutral hadrons are detected. QCD predictions agree with deep inelastic scattering (parton model), jet production in colliders, and lattice QCD simulations. Asymptotic freedom allows perturbative calculations of high-energy processes (e.g. jet cross-sections). The strong force’s short range (∼1 fm) confines nuclei, setting the scale of atomic binding energies.
Summary: In each case a classical field theory (Newton/GR, Maxwell, Fermi’s model, early nuclear forces) was supplanted by a quantum gauge theory (gravitons?, photons, W/Z, gluons). The mediating bosons, symmetries, and mechanisms differ: gravity’s geometry (and hypothetical gravitons), U(1) photons in QED, SU(2)×U(1) W/Z in electroweak theory, and SU(3) gluons in QCD. These forces govern energy, momentum, and information flow from cosmic scales (gravity) down to subatomic nuclei, with each exhibiting distinctive observable consequences (orbits and spacetime curvature for gravity; electromagnetic radiation and signals for EM; radioactive decay and parity violation for weak; and nuclear binding and asymptotic freedom for strong).
