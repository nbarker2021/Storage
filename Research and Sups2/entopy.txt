Entropy in the System — v2 (with empirical update)
1) What “entropy” means here

Ledger-entropy = a priced measure of decision uncertainty you intentionally keep when multiple near-equivalent lawful futures exist.

You spend entropy only when you retain optionality (e.g., keeping top-2 triads at n=3).

Everywhere else the pipeline is designed to be deterministic (canonical): projector, CRT merges, braid certification, E₈ snap.

Entropy here is accounting for choice retention, not thermodynamic heat.

2) Where entropy lives (by level)

n=1 (Primitives): deterministic encoding to Σ; no entropy spend.

n=2 (Pairs): guards decide cheaply; ties broken by fixed canonical order; no entropy.

n=3 (Triads): primary and intended entropy valve.

Score candidate triples by expected n=4 legalization cost.

Either commit to the mode (no spend) or keep top-2 (spend selection entropy 
𝐻
sel
H
sel
	​

).

n=4 (Quads / Projector / CRT / Braid): deterministic under fixed tie-breaks; no entropy spend.

n=5–8 (Capsules/Batching/E₈): deterministic proofs; no entropy spend.

3) Pricing & cost model (now pinned by tests)
3.1 Paid cost (per the definitive bundles)

Unit edit cost: each 
𝑒
𝑖
±
e
i
±
	​

 costs 1.

Phase receipt cost: each phase change (ΔH8 ≠ 0) incurs CARRY_COST = 4.

Symmetry moves: free (no cost, ΔH8 policy below).

Total paid cost for a run:

COST
=
#
unit edits
  
+
  
4
×
#
phase receipts
.
COST=#unit edits+4×#phase receipts.
3.2 Projector policy (QHP defaults refined)

QHP = symmetry-first CLTMP with phase lock: prefer ΔH8 = 0.

At most one phase receipt per quad when unavoidable (hard dial).

Tie-break order: (Lee distance, |ΔH8|, quadratic witness delta, lexicographic).

3.3 What counts as “entropy” vs “penalties”

Entropy: only the n=3 keep-top-2 decision (you’re paying to hold two lawful futures).

Penalties: residue edits at CRT; phase spends (ΔH8); these are priced costs or receipts, not entropy.

4) Empirical confirmation (“Free-Move Law”)

From the definitive test bundles:

Symmetry-first QHP vs Greedy (no symmetries) baseline.

Sign test: 25 wins / 0 losses for QHP (two-sided 
𝑝
≈
5.96
×
10
−
8
p≈5.96×10
−8
).

Global cost delta: −672 in QHP’s favor over 9,416 quads.

Receipts totals: QHP 8,403 vs Greedy 8,571.

“Fair” accounting (including receipts on both sides, 10 files, 4,811 quads):

Avg cost/quad: QHP 4.9206, Greedy 5.0012.

Totals: QHP 23,673 vs Greedy 24,061.

Native entropy (dataset feature): mean ~1.83–1.88 bits/digit (not a spend; describes source variability).

Takeaway: once you price only receipted work, free symmetries first + phase-lock is strictly better in practice. This validates making entropy spending rare and local (n=3 only).

; log a triad_select receipt with weights,

β, and expected ROI (see below).

5.2 Budget & dial

Entropy budget 
𝐵
𝑆
B
S
	​

: e.g., 4 per 1,000 quads (default).

Temperature 
𝛽
β: default 2.0 (peaky, stable).

Every spend decrements 
𝐵
𝑆
B
S
	​

; exceeding the budget requires a governed exception receipt (rationale must cite expected gains).

5.3 ROI (why it’s worth it)

For each kept alternative, record the expected future savings:

ROI
=
𝐸
[
−
Δ
𝜆
]
  
+
  
𝐸
[
phase receipts avoided
]
×
4
  
+
  
𝐸
[
CRT penalties avoided
]
  
−
  
𝐸
.
ROI=E[−Δλ]+E[phase receipts avoided]×4+E[CRT penalties avoided]−E.

If ROI ≤ 0, don’t keep the second route.

6) Interactions with other budgets

Phase: spending entropy at n=3 often enables a ΔH8-preserving projector choice at n=4, saving 4× per avoided phase receipt.

CRT: alternative routes may avoid higher-prime residue edits.

λ-energy gate: even with entropy spend, n=4 acceptance still requires Δλ ≤ 0 (or a governed exception with rationale).

7) Determinism & seeding

All stochasticity is made replayable:

Seed = hash(run_id || manifest_root); store it in receipts.

If you commit (no optionality kept), you spent 0 entropy even if a sampler was used.

Only retained optionality counts against the entropy budget.

9) Metrics, tests, and reporting schema
9.1 Run-level metrics

Entropy spend rate: E_{\text{perK}} = \frac{\sum \text{entropy_spent}}{\text{quads}/1000}.

Proto-braid yield: fraction of entropy spends that later certify as braids.

Entropy ROI: avg expected vs realized savings per spend.

Avg cost/quad (fair): includes phase receipts at 4×.

9.2 Tests to pin

T2 — Triad entropy reproducibility: with fixed seed & 
𝛽
β, entropy_spent and chosen top-2 are identical across runs.

Free-Move Law check: QHP vs Greedy sign test and global cost delta reported per bundle (fields below).

9.3 Standard report fields (from the bundles)

Per file (CSV/JSON):

n_quads,
QHP_cost, QHP_receipts,
Greedy_cost, Greedy_receipts,
QHP_cost_including_receipts, Greedy_cost_including_receipts,   # “fair” runs
Delta_cost(QHP-Greedy),
H_nat_bits_per_digit


Aggregate:

wins, losses, p_value_sign_test,
total_quads, total_cost_QHP, total_cost_Greedy,
total_receipts_QHP, total_receipts_Greedy

10) Recommended defaults (post-update)

CARRY_COST = 4 per phase receipt.

Symmetries free, with phase-lock, and ≤1 phase receipt per quad when unavoidable.

Entropy only at n=3, with β = 2.0 and B_S = 4 per 1,000 quads.

Tie-breaks (projector): (Lee, |ΔH8|, quadratic witness delta, lexicographic).

CRT moduli order: {3,5,9,11,13,17}; price edits as penalties, not entropy.

Bottom line

Entropy is a single, focused tool you deploy only at n=3 to keep exactly as much optionality as future savings justify. Everything else is proof-driven and deterministic. With the updated pricing (unit edits + 4× phase receipts) and the empirical QHP-over-Greedy results, the policy “free symmetries first, phase-lock, receipts-only entropy” is both theoretically clean and experimentally validated.

Note: unclear if there are n=1 instances during stuck non choice moves. possibly removed via Golden Ratio modulation handled via braiding and chirality effects. to be studided.
