===========================================================
Copyright (c) 2025, Licensor: Nick. All rights reserved.

This is a source-available, permission-only license. No rights are granted
unless and until Licensor issues a signed Permission Notice. See Sections 2–3.

1) Definitions
--------------
Software: the LFAI codebase, examples, SDKs, docs, schemas, configs, and updates.
Service: any hosted instance or API implementing the Software.
Outputs: any artifacts produced by or derived from the Software or Service.
Physical Access: obtaining, copying, hosting, executing, or otherwise using the
  Software on any hardware or storage you control.
Intellectual Access: using the Software or Outputs to create, train, tune,
  evaluate, or improve any models, datasets, systems, or workflows—including
  using Outputs as training data or ground truth.
Permission Notice: a written instrument (email, PDF, or signed file) issued by
  Licensor that identifies the Grantee, Scope, and Term and is verifiably from
  the Licensor.

2) Grant
--------
Subject to full compliance with this License and a valid Permission Notice,
Licensor grants Grantee a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
revocable license to (i) access and internally use the Software and Outputs
solely within the Scope, Territory, and Term set forth in the Permission Notice;
and (ii) make a reasonable number of internal copies solely to exercise (i).
No rights are granted absent a Permission Notice.

3) Restrictions
---------------
Unless expressly allowed in the Permission Notice, Grantee must NOT:
(a) distribute, publish, disclose, or make available the Software, Service, or
    Outputs to any third party (including via SaaS or API);
(b) modify, translate, adapt, create derivative works, or port the Software,
    except for configuration needed to deploy it as provided;
(c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive
    source code, models, weights, or trade secrets, except to the minimal
    extent required by law for interoperability and only after written notice;
(d) use the Software or Outputs for model training, dataset creation, evaluation,
    benchmarking, or publishing performance claims without explicit written permission;
(e) use the Software or Outputs to train, tune, or improve any system other than
    the Licensed instance defined in the Permission Notice;
(f) remove or alter proprietary notices, anchors, ledgers, or parity paints; or
    circumvent gating, legality checks, or commit rules;
(g) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, or transfer the Software, Service,
    or any rights hereunder;
(h) use the Software unlawfully or to violate third-party rights.
All use must honor both Physical and Intellectual access controls.

4) Confidentiality
------------------
Software and non‑public Outputs are Licensor Confidential Information. Grantee
must protect them with at least reasonable care and not disclose except as
permitted in the Permission Notice.

5) Ownership; Feedback
----------------------
Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, Outputs,
and all IP therein. No implied licenses. Feedback is voluntary; Licensor may use
it without restriction.

6) Patents
----------
No patent rights are granted except the bare right necessary to use the Software
as permitted by an active Permission Notice. No patent license is granted for
derivative works or other implementations.

7) Compliance & Audit
---------------------
Upon reasonable notice during the Term and for one (1) year after, Grantee will
provide logs/attestations sufficient to verify compliance (anchors/ledgers are
sufficient if enabled). Licensor may revoke the Permission Notice for material
breach or misuse.

8) Term; Termination
--------------------
Effective upon issuance of a valid Permission Notice; ends at the earlier of
the Term end date or Licensor termination for breach. Upon expiration/termination,
all rights cease and Grantee must cease use and destroy or return Software and
non‑public Outputs (except as required by law).

9) Warranty Disclaimer
----------------------
THE SOFTWARE AND OUTPUTS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, OR ACCURACY.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES,
OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY
WILL NOT EXCEED US$100.

11) Export; Compliance
----------------------
Grantee must comply with applicable laws, including export controls and sanctions.

12) Governing Law; Venue
------------------------

Licensor’s principal place of business apply, excluding conflicts rules and CISG.

13) Entire Agreement; Precedence

This License + any Permission Notice are the entire agreement for the subject
matter. Conflicts: Permission Notice > this License.
