Doc I — Evidence, Audit, and Traceability (RAG, Ledgers, Merkle, Provenance)
Purpose: Make every accepted move reconstructible from CSVs alone. This chapter defines evidence cards, quote ↔ span anchoring, promotion proof bundles, rolling ledgers & optional Merkle checkpoints, audit workflows, incident triage, and the exact validators that enforce faithfulness and traceability across Master and Orbit. All artifacts are CSV‑first; no hidden state.
I1. Evidence Layer Overview
• Evidence = RAG grounding + lineage. Every meaning Atom Card must be supported by quotes that map to canonical chunks. Embedding cards inherit lineage from their sibling meaning cards or explicit references.
• Two planes: 
• Orbit (working) — provisional evidence, multiple candidate quotes, contradictions permitted and logged.
• Master (best‑of) — accepted evidence with a PromotionContract and zero unresolved contradictions.
• Proof bundle: Promotion to Master requires a PromotionContract referencing evidence sets, law refs, watchers, and energy terms.
Outputs (CSV/JSON):
• EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv — flattened claim ↔ quote ↔ chunk mapping.
• evidence_cards.json — structured evidence packs per candidate (Doc F).
• LEDGER_WINDOWS.csv & (optional) MERKLE_WINDOWS.csv — rolling hashes and Merkle roots.
• AUDIT_TRAIL.csv — audit actions and outcomes.
• CONTRADICTIONS.csv — detected contradictions and resolution status.
I2. Evidence Objects
I2.1 Meaning Atom Card (recap)
Minimal unit with claim_text, quote_text, span_start/end, doc_id, chunk_id, glyph triad, and governance fields. See Docs A–D schemas.
I2.2 Evidence Link (flattened)
One row per (claim atom ↔ quote span) association.
Schema — EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv
run_id,atom_id,doc_id,chunk_id,span_start,span_end,text_hash,quote_excerpt,alignment_method,alignment_score,law_ref,law_hash,is_master,created_at 
• alignment_method: {exact_span, fuzzy_jaccard, fuzzy_cosine} (deterministic; thresholds fixed in ops.yml).
• alignment_score: float 0..1 (round to 4 decimals).
• law_ref: optional law_id when the evidence directly supports an IRL claim.
• is_master: true if the claim has been promoted; else false.
Validation:
• text_hash must match MASTER_DOCUMENT_INTAKE.text_hash for (doc_id, chunk_id).
• span_start..span_end must lie within the chunk offsets.
• quote_excerpt equals canonical substring of the chunk after NFC normalization.
I2.3 Evidence Cards (structured)
evidence_cards.json (Doc F) groups the links with geometry/octadic facts and is referenced by policy and contracts. Deterministic fields only; no RNG.
I3. Ledger & Merkle — Tamper Evident
I3.1 Rolling Ledger (per window)
• Every accepted row carries a ledger_hash = SHA256(prev_ledger_hash | glyph_id | atom_id | step_index).
• LEDGER_WINDOWS.csv provides window headers and continuity.
run_id,packet_id,window_id,first_ledger_hash,last_ledger_hash,row_count,created_at 
I3.2 Merkle (optional)
• For each window, compute a Merkle tree over ordered (glyph_id | atom_id | step_index) leaves; store root in MERKLE_WINDOWS.csv.
run_id,packet_id,window_id,merkle_root,hash_fn,tree_order 
• Validation allows external proof via leaf→root paths.
I3.3 Determinism requirements
• Row order within a window is (step_index, atom_id).
• Hash function, normalization, and concatenation scheme are frozen per ops.yml.
I4. Promotion Proof Bundle
A Master row is illegal without a contract and evidence links.
Bundle contents (all IDs/hashes must resolve):
• PromotionContract (Doc D) with contract_hash.
• Evidence set from EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv (≥1 link for meaning cards).
• Law refs from LAWS_VALIDATION.csv when context_source=IRL and truth_value=T.
• Policy/Evidence cards (Doc F) used in the decision.
• Buffer Gate snapshots (Doc H) for the even acceptance step.
• Ledger/Merkle header for the window/packet.
Validation: Recompute hashes and confirm all foreign keys; reject Master append if any component fails.
I5. Audit Workflows (CSV‑only)
I5.1 Spot Check (single claim)
• Get the Master row by atom_id.
• Follow promotion_contract_hash → PROMOTION_CONTRACTS.csv.
• Join to EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv by atom_id.
• Verify spans and quote_excerpt against MASTER_DOCUMENT_INTAKE by (doc_id,chunk_id,text_hash).
• Recompute ledger_hash path through LEDGER_WINDOWS.csv (and MERKLE_WINDOWS.csv if enabled).
• Record result in AUDIT_TRAIL.csv.
Schema — AUDIT_TRAIL.csv
run_id,audit_id,atom_id,auditor_id,scope,outcome,issues,ts 
• scope: {spot, packet, corpus}; outcome: {pass, fail, partial}.
I5.2 Packet Audit
• Verify all rows in a window: recompute rolling hashes; (optionally) Merkle proofs.
• Check Buffer Gate events for entropy floors and constraint IDs/hashes.
I5.3 Corpus Audit / Golden Master
• Keep golden_master/ directory with frozen CSVs for a reference corpus.
• Re‑run pipeline and diff CSVs (except created_at) → differences must be explainable via ops.yml changes; else fail.
I6. Contradictions & Resolutions
• During Orbit, a claim may have conflicts with other atoms (same scope, opposite truth).
• Record in CONTRADICTIONS.csv with adjudication outcomes.
run_id,atom_id_a,atom_id_b,scope,reason,status,resolution_atom_id,ts 
• Status: {open, resolved, retired}.
• Master cannot admit a claim with an open contradiction unless explicitly waived by governance; waiver must be recorded in the contract.
I7. Validators (Evidence & Audit)
• Span overlap: (span_start..span_end) lies within chunk offsets; quote_excerpt matches canonical substring (NFC).
• Quote alignment method: if {fuzzy_jaccard,fuzzy_cosine}, score ≥ thresholds; exact match preferred.
• Law linkage: IRL truth=T must FK to LAWS_VALIDATION; else demote to U.
• Ledger integrity: re‑hash per window; first/last hashes match LEDGER_WINDOWS headers.
• Merkle integrity (optional): recompute root; match MERKLE_WINDOWS.
• Contract completeness: evidence set non‑empty for meaning cards; contract hash equals recomputed JSON hash.
• Audit logging: every failed check writes an AUDIT_TRAIL.csv row and an incident with details.
I8. KPIs & Dashboards (computed from CSV)
• Faithfulness (f) = COUNT(EVIDENCE_LINKS where is_master=true) / COUNT(MASTER_GPT_TRUTH meaning cards).
• Traceability (τ) = % Master rows with glyph_id + span + evidence links + contract hash.
• Lawfulness (ℓIRL) = % IRL truths with valid law refs.
• Integrity (η) = packet audits passed / packets.
• Resolution rate (ρ) = resolved / (resolved+open) in CONTRADICTIONS.
• Audit coverage (α) = audited atoms / total Master atoms.

I9. Operator Checklists
Before Orbit write
• [ ] Meaning cards include quote spans and excerpts
• [ ] EVIDENCE_LINKS rows created for each quote
Before Master promotion
• [ ] Evidence set referenced in contract; all FKs resolve
• [ ] Law refs present for IRL truths
• [ ] Packet/window hashes recorded
Audits
• [ ] Spot checks for top‑impact atoms
• [ ] Packet audits after each run
• [ ] Golden‑master regression diff after config changes
I10. Examples
I10.1 Exact‑span evidence
• Claim atom a:… cites (docX, chunk 12, 103..154); text_hash = sha256:…. NFC substring matches quote_excerpt. alignment_method=exact_span, alignment_score=1.0.
I10.2 Fuzzy alignment with law
• Claim uses paraphrase; alignment_method=fuzzy_jaccard, score 0.83 ≥ τ=0.8. Law EM‑001 linked; contract OK.
I10.3 Ledger + Merkle verification
• Recompute per‑row rolling hash → last hash equals LEDGER_WINDOWS.last_ledger_hash. Merkle root rederived from ordered leaves matches MERKLE_WINDOWS.merkle_root.
I11. Governance, Privacy, and Redaction
• Redaction: if a quote contains sensitive data, store a hashed mask in quote_excerpt and keep the exact span for audit under access control; the text_hash still validates integrity.
• PII: flag in EVIDENCE_LINKS with scope=restricted; audits require elevated role.
• Retention: Master evidence is append‑only; deprecations mark state flips, never deletes.
I12. Interfaces
• Doc D: Contracts enumerate evidence sets; audits verify.
• Doc F: Evidence cards tie to futures; policy selections cite evidence.
• Doc H: Buffer events included in proof bundle; energy terms verified.
• Doc C: Validators for schema/FKs/types; init headers for new CSVs.
I13. Summary
This chapter guarantees faithful grounding (quotes → spans → chunks), tamper‑evident ledgers (rolling/Merkle), and complete promotion proofs (contracts + evidence + laws + buffers + ledgers). With these artifacts and validators, any claim can be independently reconstructed, audited, and reproduced from CSVs alone.
