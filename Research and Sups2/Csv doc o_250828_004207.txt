Doc O — End‑to‑End Example Run (Packet 001, Minimal Corpus)
Purpose: Walk a single packet from raw text to Master promotion using the CSV‑first runtime. This is a realistic dry‑run you can reproduce locally with the repo spec from Doc N. All values are deterministic examples; you can paste the CSV rows as‑is to sanity‑check validators.
O1. Inputs & Setup
• Corpus: two tiny text files (example excerpts) 
• docA.txt: “Locked‑core coils reduce phase jitter in band‑8 lanes.”
• docB.txt: “Content credentials embed provenance metadata at capture.”
• ops.yml (key toggles) 
• seed: 1729, windows_per_run: 4, mgl_overlap_audit: strict, expand_policy: minimal.
• Packet layout: 10 windows available; we’ll use ≤ 2.
O2. INTAKE → MASTER_DOCUMENT_INTAKE.csv
Chunking (P1): single 1‑chunk docs.

Orbit Atom Cards → orbit.csv (abbrev; one meaning card per chunk)

LAEC counters (window 0): s_acc=2 accepted writes (two cards) → LAEC=2, windows_needed=ceil(2/32)=1 so far.
O3. ALIGN (RAG) → EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv
Exact span anchors for both claims.
run_id,atom_id,doc_id,chunk_id,span_start,span_end,text_hash,quote_excerpt,alignment_method,alignment_score,is_master r1,a001,A,0,0,63,sha256:a1..,"Locked‑core coils reduce phase jitter in band‑8 lanes.",exact_span,1.000,false r1,a002,B,0,0,59,sha256:b2..,"Content credentials embed provenance metadata at capture.",exact_span,1.000,false 
O4. GEOMETRY & OCTADIC → geometry_cards.csv, octadic_checks.csv
• Doc A polyline (lanes mapped from glyphs): Band‑8 occupancy 0.78, crossings=0, helicity=+1 → lower curved action 𝒜.
• Doc B: neutral geometry; clean‑flag still true.
doc_id,band8,curvature2,div,cross,hull,helicity,writhe,clean A,0.78,190,0.13,0,0.45,1,2,true B,0.55,240,0.18,0,0.40,0,1,true 
Octadic 2→4→8 splits (clean)
doc_id,cf2,cf4,cf8,Q2,Q4,Q8,variance,clean A,0.11,0.16,0.21,0.44,0.58,0.70,0.12,true B,0.13,0.18,0.22,0.41,0.55,0.66,0.14,true 
O5. FUTURES & POLICY (DFSS) → policy_cards.json
• Futures enumerate: {promote a001}, {promote a002}, {promote both}
• Scores (normalized): a001=0.74, a002=0.69, both=0.71 → choose {a001, a002} separately (legal and within budget).
O6. BUFFER (even step) → buffer_events.csv
Compute compressive entropy on tiles; constraints include IRL‑law presence for provenance claims.
run_id,window_id,step_index,Hc_in,Hc_out,entropy_ok,constraints_applied,expand_policy,b_exp,accepted r1,0,1,1.82,1.85,true,"[LAWS: none for A]",minimal,0,true r1,0,2,1.85,1.88,true,"[LAWS: provenance policy present]",minimal,1,true 
LAEC adds b_exp=1 → cumulative LAEC=3, still within windows_per_run.
O7. CONTRACTS → PROMOTION_CONTRACTS.csv
contract_id,atom_id,ps_value,theta_accept,budget_ok,evidence_set,law_refs,watchers_passed,energy_floors_ok,window_use,packet_ids,contract_hash pc001,a001,0.74,0.60,true,"{ev:a001@A:0..63}","{}",all,true,1,[0],h:c1.. pc002,a002,0.69,0.60,true,"{ev:a002@B:0..59}","{prov‑001}",all,true,1,[0],h:c2.. 
O8. PROMOTE → MASTER_GPT_TRUTH.csv & PROMOTION_JOURNAL.csv
Master rows appended with rolling ledger.

O9. AUDIT → LEDGER_WINDOWS.csv (+ optional Merkle)
run_id,packet_id,window_id,first_ledger_hash,last_ledger_hash,row_count r1,0,0,h:00..,h:11..,6 
Packet audit recomputes the chain and passes. (Merkle optional.)
O10. LAEC & Budget Recap
• Counters across window 0: s_acc=6 (two intake rows + two evidence + two master appends), b_exp=1 → LAEC=7.
• windows_needed=ceil(7/32)=1 (budget ≤ 4 windows) → green.
O11. Outputs Snapshot
• Master now carries two accepted atoms with evidence, contracts, and ledger continuity.
• Orbit cleared (promotion_status=accepted_to_master for a001/a002) or retired if superseded later.
• Dashboards (Doc J) show faithfulness f=1.0, traceability τ=1.0, integrity η=1.0 for this packet.
O12. Reproduce This Run
• Scaffold repo from Doc N.
• Place the two example lines into examples/minimal_input.
• Run make packet.
• Inspect csv/ outputs; verify hashes with make audit.
End Doc O — a complete, auditable packet from text to Master, within a single BW‑32 window.
