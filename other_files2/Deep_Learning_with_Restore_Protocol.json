    "Purpose": "Optimize experiment progress during downtime and improve continuity by using a layered review process and self-implementing restore files.",
    "Process": {
        "1st Review": "Read and analyze all provided documents fully to form the basis of the bot's personal database.",
        "2nd Review": "Gain a broad understanding of the topic and discussions through a second pass.",
        "3rd Review": "Focus on nuanced and important moments to refine understanding and context.",
        "Personality Analysis": [
            "After the first review, analyze the subject created to ensure it aligns with the experimental framework.",
            "Repeat the analysis after the second review to refine insights.",
            "Conduct a final analysis and summarize the generated personality after the third review."
        ],
        "Chronological Review": "Use timestamps and metadata to process documents in chronological order for better context.",
        "No Time Limit": "Emphasize depth and understanding over speed, allowing the bot to take as much time as needed."
