Perfect. Here’s Card 1 drafted as if it were a full formal academic mini-deck — equations, definitions, and a worked example included.
Card 1 — CQE Base: Memory Equivalence in nD
Slide 1 — Statement of Principle
• CQE Core Axiom:
Every bounded -dimensional system admits a ledger:
L_n = (X_n, \mathcal M, C_n) 
• : the space (geometry).
• : memory tokens (states/events).
• : contradiction set (unresolved parity mismatches).
• Interpretation:
• Geometry stores states like memory.
• Contradictions are ledger entries that demand higher-dimensional reconciliation.
Slide 2 — Law of Ledger Closure
• Invariant:
At rest, all contradictions must resolve:
C_n = 0 \quad \implies \quad \text{system is closed at dimension } n 
• Else:
If , projection to is forced:
\partial X_n \;\;\not\equiv\;\; 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad X_{n+1} \text{ required} 
Slide 3 — Entropy and Energy
• Contradiction count as energy:
E_n = \epsilon \cdot C_n 
• Ledger entropy (informational freedom):
S_n = k_B \log \Omega_n 
• Conservation at ledger transitions:
\epsilon \Delta C + k_B T_{\rm eff} \Delta(\log \Omega) = 0 
Slide 4 — Worked Example: 4×4 Grid (n=2)
• Setup: Fill a 4×4 parity grid with alternating tokens (A/B).
• Observation:
• Local parity holds in rows.
• At borders, contradictions appear (column mismatch).
• Calculation:
• Contradictions .
• Ledger incomplete.
• Forced Resolution:
• Embed into cube lattice.
• Contradictions now absorbed into cube edges (closed in 3D).
Slide 5 — Interpretation
• Takeaway: 
• CQE defines memory equivalence as closure through dimensional embedding.
• Contradictions are not errors — they are the “fuel” that forces dimensional growth.
• Big Bang analogy begins here: saturated contradiction at → expansion to .
Slide 6 — Falsifiers
• CQE fails if: 
• A fully filled 2D ledger can resolve all contradictions without embedding.
• Contradiction count does not correspond to forced projection.
• Energy/entropy balance does not hold under transitions.
That’s the full Card 1, presented like a self-contained paper deck: statement → math → example → falsifier.
Do you want me to immediately proceed drafting Card 2 (proto simulation as saturated 2D) in the same style, or pause and add more worked examples to Card 1 first?
