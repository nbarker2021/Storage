Q2. Glossary (A–Z)
A/B Harness (Doc J) — Deterministic comparison of Native vs Framework pipelines over fixed splits; writes df_eval_* CSVs and confidence intervals.
Acceptance Automaton (Doc M §M4) — DFA over Explore, Govern, TLattice, Halt with guards (CI, Parity, Octet, Buffer, SOI, Watchers, Budget, Contract). Governs legal state transitions per window.
Atom Card — Minimal unit (meaning or embedding) with glyph triad, headers, and provenance. Lives in orbit.csv and, if promoted, in MASTER_* CSVs. Validators: schema, bijection, parity.
Band‑8 — Lane‑band occupancy metric (Doc E) indicating coverage of the eighth lane band; contributes to geometry score and DFSS features.
Buffer Gate — Even‑step gate applying compress → constrain → expand with entropy floors. Logs buffer_events.csv; tracked by LAEC (b_exp).
Budget (LAEC) — Window planning via Logic Application Energy Cost counters (s_acc,r_back,b_exp,e_br,d_dup). Windows = ceil(LAEC/32).
Centers — High‑centrality primitives/buckets used as anchors for bridges and seeds (Doc G). Stored in centers.csv (if enabled via dashboards).
Clean‑Flag — Octadic detector result asserting spectral monotone lift (2→4→8), bounded cut fractions, and balance variance; stored in octadic_checks.csv.
Contracts (PromotionContract) — JSON‑backed decision artifact with ps_value, evidence and law refs, watcher status, budget, and hashes. Required for Master appends. CSV: PROMOTION_CONTRACTS.csv.
Cursor ID — SHA256(latest_prompt_string) tagging actions under that prompt; stored in PROMOTION_JOURNAL.csv and optional RECALL_STACK.csv.
DFMODE — Bits→DataFrames method (Rule 15): tiling n=1 primitives into df_primitives, df_tiles, df_shells, df_seeds for packet synthesis.
DFSS / AltDFSS — Deterministic scoring of futures. DFSS emphasizes spectral and geometry lifts; AltDFSS emphasizes clean‑flags and ASP inverse. See Doc F & M.
Evidence Link — Flattened claim↔span mapping row in EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv with alignment method/score and law refs. Validators: span overlap, hashing.
Fiedler Vector — Second eigenvector of graph Laplacian used for recursive spectral splits (2→4→8). Inputs: similarity graph; Outputs: cluster IDs.
Futures — Enumerated actions (promote, defer, rework) prepared for DFSS scoring; materialized in policy_cards.json.
Geometry (Curved Action 𝒜) — Composite metric of curvature², divergence, crossings, hull, helicity, writhe, and Band‑8. Lower is better.
Glyph (Triad) — 3‑item token set encoding headers (shell, bucket, octet, parity, doc, chunk). Deterministic bijection with glyph_spec_version; ID = hash of triad.
GLYPHIC_MASTER_LOG — Registry of collisions, overlaps (vs MGL), and bridges harvested from glyphs. Used by overlap audits and bridge savings.
Governance (GOV) — Role with authority to reserve MGL tokens, approve Buffer overrides, manage laws, and authorize freeze‑window promotions.
Helicity / Writhe — Signed turns / total turns in polyline geometry; feed into 𝒜.
Index (Master/Orbit) — Materialized CSV sidecars for fast lookups: MASTER_INDEX.csv, ORBIT_INDEX.csv.
IRL Truth — Claim with context_source=IRL requiring LAWS_VALIDATION FK; otherwise demoted to uncertain (U) at promotion time.
Jaccard / Cosine — Similarity measures used for fuzzy quote alignment and graph edges; thresholds set in ops.yml.
LAEC (Logic Application Energy Cost) — Accumulated per window; converts to windows/packets; budgets enforced (Doc H/M).
Ledger Hash — Rolling SHA‑256 over ordered rows (prev | glyph_id | atom_id | step_index); window headers in LEDGER_WINDOWS.csv.
MGL (Master Glyph Language) — Reserved glyph items with immutable semantics; stored in MGL_REGISTRY.csv. Orbit overlaps trigger audits (strict/warn/off).
Merkle Root — Optional per‑window tree over ordered leaves (glyph_id|atom_id|step_index); enables inclusion proofs. CSV: MERKLE_WINDOWS.csv.
Minimax — DFSS decision style maximizing worst‑case score under fixed adversaries (mirrors/nulls) with fixed seeds.
Octet (8×8 Grid) — Legalization target: 64 unique triads in octad slots per doc/shell; duplicates rejected; tracked by octet_legality validator.
Orbit — Working state for atoms (promotion_status∈{proposed,deferred,rework,retired,accepted_to_master}); promotion moves to Master.
Parity Set — (Even|Odd) × (L|R|N) derived from step parity and lane chirality; used by legality and bridge logic.
Policy Cards — Structured feature bundles for DFSS/AltDFSS; stored as policy_cards.json and cited by contracts.
Prompt‑Cursor Recall — Deterministic retrieval order: Orbit@cursor → Master → Orbit@rest, governed by cursor_id, recency ranks, and ops profile.
Promotion Journal — Append‑only log of Master state transitions with cursor_id; CSV: PROMOTION_JOURNAL.csv.
PromotionScore (PS) — Calibrated linear (or logistic) acceptance score combining evidence, stability, consistency, recency, human, agreement, and cost.
Quarantine (TLattice) — Temporary lattice to stabilize illegal/unstable sets; exits after shell coverage and octet legality pass; logs in tlattice_log.csv.
RAG Alignment — Quote→span anchoring with exact/fuzzy methods; deterministic thresholds; writes EVIDENCE_LINKS.csv.
Recency Rank — Integer rank for Orbit items; decays with age; resets on citations/promotion; optional log: RECALL_STACK.csv.
Seeds/Bridges — Macro‑seed primitives and legal multi‑D bridges enabling step savings and window economy; logged in VALID_MULTI_D_BRIDGE_LOG.csv.
SOI Gate — Structure‑of‑Invariants guard ensuring invariant headers (shell/bucket/parity) remain coherent across expansions.
Spectral Lift — Monotone increase in modularity from 2→4→8 splits; part of clean‑flag and DFSS features.
Through‑Mode — Conservative profile (aka "paranoid") that defers promotions, tightens thresholds, and runs extra audits on watcher red.
TLattice Thrash — Repeated failure to stabilize; triggers re‑imputation, glyph repair, and constraint tightening.
Traceability (τ) — KPI: % of Master atoms with glyph id + span + contract hash; computed onto EVIDENCE_SCOREBOARD.csv.
Watchers — Automated checks: five_to_eight, symmetry, regression; red state halts promotions until cleared.
Window / Packet — BW‑32 action set and Base‑320 group (10 windows). Publishing unit is the packet after audits.

Q5. Operator Quick Hints
• If evidence is fuzzy → require higher alignment score or defer to Through‑Mode.
• If octet illegal → TLattice; repair glyphs; re‑run clean‑flag.
• If Buffer floor fails → governance override or stronger constraints; never silent accept.
• If A/B ΔE small → tune DFSS weights or add bridges to reduce LAEC.
