Fundamental Forces and Constants
Standard Interactions: Physics recognizes four fundamental forces. Gravity is described by General Relativity (mediated by the hypothetical graviton) and governs large-scale motion (planetary orbits, lensing, gravitational waves). It is extremely weak (∼10^–39 the strength of the strong force at typical scales). Electromagnetism (photon mediator) unifies electric and magnetic phenomena (Maxwell’s equations) and underlies atomic forces. Its coupling is set by the fine-structure constant α≈1/137. The Weak Force (W^±, Z^0 bosons) acts at subatomic distances (~10^–18 m) and governs processes like β-decay; it is short-range (massive mediators) and much weaker than electromagnetism (~10^–5 of strong, per the table). The Strong Force (gluons, color charge) confines quarks into nuclei (range ∼10^–15 m) and is normalized to strength 1 in Table 5. All SM forces arise from gauge symmetries (U(1), SU(2), SU(3)), so that U(1) yields 1 generator (photon), SU(2) yields 3 bosons (W^±,Z), and SU(3) yields 8 gluons. For example, the photon mediates electromagnetism, the W/Z mediate weak interactions, and 8 gluons mediate the strong force. Gravity’s quantum mediator (graviton) is not yet observed, but GR’s predictions (e.g. gravitational waves) were confirmed by LIGO.
Emergent and Hypothetical Forces: Beyond the four pillars, physics considers other “force‐like” effects. Dark Energy (Λ) is a repulsive component driving cosmic acceleration, observed via Type Ia supernovae and CMB anisotropies. The simplest model is Einstein’s cosmological constant Λ (vacuum energy density), which contributes ≈68–73% of the Universe’s energy. Its mediating mechanism is not a particle but a uniform vacuum energy; if dynamical, models invoke a light scalar (“quintessence”). Theoretical issue: naive QFT predicts vacuum energy ∼10^121 times larger than observed, a notorious fine-tuning problem. Inflation (Inflaton Field) is a hypothesized scalar field causing an early exponential expansion. It solves horizon/flatness problems and predicts nearly scale-invariant primordial perturbations. Observations of the cosmic microwave background (WMAP/Planck) confirm inflation’s predictions. The inflaton’s quantum fluctuations seeded galaxies. Mediator: a postulated inflaton particle (scalar); observables: CMB power spectrum, primordial gravitational waves (not yet seen).
Entropic (Emergent) Forces: Some theories treat gravity as emergent. In particular, Verlinde (2010) proposed that gravity is an entropic force arising from information/entropy gradients. In this view, moving mass changes the entropy of microscopic degrees of freedom (à la polymer elasticity, Fig.1 in Verlinde’s paper) and an effective force appears. This idea reproduces Newton’s laws and GR in certain limits but remains speculative. (It is a “thermodynamic” force rather than a fundamental gauge interaction.)
Casimir Effect (Quantum Vacuum Force): The Casimir effect is a measurable attraction between uncharged conductors due to quantum vacuum fluctuations. Two parallel metal plates restrict electromagnetic modes, creating a net force. Theoretically it can be derived without invoking literal zero-point “energy” of the vacuum. Rather, it is a relativistic quantum force between currents and charges. Experiments have confirmed the Casimir force at micron scales. It serves as evidence of vacuum-field effects but is not a new fundamental interaction – rather an emergent quantum effect from QED.
Fifth-Force Candidates: Various experiments have sought forces beyond the four known types. Typically such forces are modeled by adding a Yukawa term to Newton’s law, mediated by a new light boson. So far no definitive fifth force has been found. Precision tests (torsion balances, atomic spectroscopy, neutron experiments) place tight limits on any extra 1/r^2 or short-range force (comparable to gravity only below sub-millimeter scales). Recently, anomalies in nuclear decays (e.g. the “X17” effect in ^8Be and ^4He) have been reported that might hint at a new ~17 MeV boson coupling weakly to protons. One analysis found that a protophobic vector boson at ~17 MeV could explain the data. However this remains controversial. Other proposed mediators (dark photons, chameleon scalars, etc.) are heavily constrained by experiments. In summary, any genuine fifth force would require a new gauge particle coupling to known matter, but current data only allow very feeble couplings or very short ranges.
Universal Constants
Dimensional Constants: The fundamental constants with dimensions set the scales of physics. For example, the speed of light c (exactly 299,792,458 m/s in SI) links space and time and appears in relativity (E=mc^2). Planck’s reduced constant ℏ (≈1.054×10^–34 J·s) fixes the quantum of action and governs quantum effects (uncertainty, quantization). Newton’s gravitational constant G (≈6.67×10^–11 N·m²/kg²) sets the strength of gravity. Boltzmann’s constant k_B (≈1.38×10^–23 J/K) relates temperature to energy (entropy S=k_BlnW). In SI electromagnetism, the vacuum permittivity ε₀ and permeability μ₀ enter Coulomb’s law and Maxwell’s equations (with c²=1/(ε₀μ₀)). In Planck (natural) units, one sets c=G=ℏ=k_B=1, so these constants disappear from equations. In that system the Planck length (~1.6×10^–35 m), time, and energy (~1.2×10^19 GeV) become natural scales. All dimensional constants essentially serve to convert between human-defined units; their numerical values depend on our unit choices.
Dimensionless Constants: Pure numbers characterize interaction strengths and mass ratios. The fine-structure constant α≈1/137 measures the electromagnetic coupling e²/(4π ε₀ℏc). The proton‐electron mass ratio m_p/m_e≈1836 is crucial for chemistry. The Weinberg (weak-mixing) angle sin²θ_W≈0.23 determines the relative W and Z masses in electroweak theory. The cosmological constant is often expressed as the dimensionless density parameter Ω_Λ≈0.68 (fraction of critical density). These values appear arbitrary in the Standard Model and cosmology, and form the basis of fine‐tuning discussions. For instance, if α or m_p/m_e were significantly different, atoms or stars might not form. Such coincidences motivate anthropic arguments (next).
Natural Units and Fine-Tuning: In naturalized unit systems (c=ℏ=k_B=1, etc.), many constants vanish from formulas, highlighting dimensionless numbers as the true “tunable” parameters. The fine-tuning of parameters (e.g. why the electroweak scale is ≪ Planck scale) poses deep puzzles. The celebrated hierarchy problem asks why the Higgs mass (weak scale) is ∼10^–17 of the Planck mass; quantum corrections would naturally push it to the cutoff unless cancellations occur. Similarly, the cosmological constant is empirically 120 orders of magnitude smaller than naive vacuum energy estimates.
Anthropic and Variability: One viewpoint is that some constants might vary in a multiverse and we observe ones compatible with life. Weinberg argued that Λ cannot be arbitrarily large or galaxies would not form. In his anthropic argument, a universe with too-large Λ would forbid bound structures, so observers only exist in regions with Λ below a critical (vast but finite) bound. More generally, anthropic reasoning has been applied to explain why α, the electron mass, etc. lie in habitable ranges. Observationally, stringent bounds exist on time-variation of constants (for example, quasar spectra limit Δα/α to ~10^–6 over cosmological times). These issues remain speculative, but highlight the interplay of physics and selection effects.
Philosophical and Information-Theoretic Interpretations
Symmetry and Conservation (Noether’s Theorem): Modern physics sees forces as consequences of symmetries. Noether’s theorem rigorously ties each continuous symmetry to a conservation law. For example, U(1) gauge symmetry implies electric charge conservation; time-translation symmetry implies energy conservation. In the Standard Model, gauge symmetries U(1), SU(2), SU(3) underlie electromagnetism, weak, and strong forces. The generators of these symmetry groups correspond to the force carriers (1 photon for U(1), 3 W/Z for SU(2), 8 gluons for SU(3)). Thus, conservation laws and force carriers are two faces of symmetry. One may view physical laws as arising from deeper symmetries; any “new” force would require extending these symmetries or introducing new ones.
Landauer’s Principle (Thermodynamics of Information): From an information-theoretic perspective, computing and physics intertwine. Landauer showed that erasing one bit of information has an irreducible cost: at least k_B T ln2 of heat must be dissipated. In other words, logical irreversibility implies physical irreversibility. This principle ties computation to thermodynamics, suggesting that physical constants like k_B play a role in information processing limits. It also frames “forces” in terms of entropy: e.g. entropic forces emerge from maximization of entropy subject to constraints.
Holographic Principle and Entropy Bounds: A striking idea is that information capacity is bounded by area, not volume. Bousso reviews how black-hole entropy (S=A/4ℓ_P^2) implies that any surface of area A can store at most ∼A/(Planck length)^2 bits. This holographic principle suggests spacetime geometry and information content are dual. In this view, a region’s degrees of freedom (hence possible physical states) scale with surface area. If true, gravity itself emerges from information constraints on a “bulk” region. The principle has influenced ideas in quantum gravity (e.g. AdS/CFT), and hints that forces might be understood as emergent from deeper informational laws.
Entropy, Computation and Causality: More generally, one can interpret physical laws as rules for information flow. The second law (entropy increase) guides macroscopic evolution (e.g. the Maximum Entropy Production Principle posits systems far from equilibrium evolve to maximize entropy production, though its status is debated). Causal structure is limited by constants: c bounds how fast information propagates (no signal faster than light), and ℏ limits precision (uncertainty relations). In theories of emergent physics, these constants set computability limits: e.g. Seth Lloyd estimates the total number of operations since the Big Bang by combining G, c, ℏ [Ref.]. In computational terms, one might view the Universe as a quantum “computer” with fundamental constants as hardware specifications.
Examples and Figures
Figure: Energy composition of the universe (Planck 2013 results). Observational data show that about 68% of the universe’s energy is dark energy (Λ), ~27% is dark matter, and ~5% is ordinary matter. This “budget” underscores how dominant Λ is in cosmic dynamics. (By comparison, the energy density of a dark-energy vacuum, ~6×10^–10 J/m^3, is minuscule locally, but uniform; see.)
Other useful visualizations include force strength vs. distance plots and running coupling graphs, which illustrate how the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces change with energy scale (unifying near the GUT scale) while gravity remains separate. Likewise, tables of constants (e.g. Planck units) clarify hierarchies: the Planck energy (~1.2×10^19 GeV) dwarfs the electroweak scale (~10^2 GeV), exemplifying the hierarchy problem. A sample constants table might list:

These figures and tables, combined with the theoretical discussions above, illustrate the quantitative structure of our physical laws. Each force and constant is deeply embedded in field theories and cosmology.
