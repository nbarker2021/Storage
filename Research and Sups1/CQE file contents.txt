Cartan Quadratic Equivalence (QCE) — Project Index

This index tracks all whitepapers, decks, and artifacts.
Each entry shows Tier → Title → Scope → Status.

Stage 1 — Anchor Claims (Tier A + B)

These are the foundation; they must be filled first.

Tier A (IRL Anchor Laws)

Entropy Localization — Maps entropy to boundary-only, aligns with thermodynamic law revision. → Status: placeholder

Least Action Equivalence — Shows least-action savings = entropy-energy equivalence. → Status: placeholder

Lattice Universality — Embeds E8/Leech as universal packing media; links to experimental analogues. → Status: placeholder

Tier B (Framework Mechanics)

BRS (Best Representation State) — Dimensional match, AWB cancellation, Hodge split minimality. → Status: draft in progress

BRM (Base-80 Mirror) — CRT(16,5), radix mirror regime; base-80 as natural audit radix. → Status: draft in progress

AWB Compression — Active Workbody = free algebra → quotient; records structural dividend. → Status: placeholder

UDMS Duplex — Palindromic dual symmetry gates; escrow parity across states. → Status: placeholder

Stage 2 — Technical Structure (Tier C)

Support mechanisms that keep the framework consistent.

CRT Defect & Primes — Coprime channel recomposition; defect receipts; ties to code-lattice methods. → Status: placeholder

Hodge Entropy Ledger — Exact/coexact/harmonic decomposition; entropy ledgerization. → Status: placeholder

ALENA Parity — Code-syndrome parity checks at ports; aligns with Construction A/B (E8, Leech). → Status: placeholder

Stage 3 — Case Studies (Tier D)

Direct experimental analogues; each one a paper.

Quantum Pinning — Flux pinning, coherence, lattice-bound stability. → Status: placeholder

DNA Neural Networks — Base-4 encoding as biological implementation; direct mirror of QCE framework. → Status: placeholder

Topological Photonic Coupling — NV center + topological waveguide = natural chiral audits. → Status: placeholder

Stage 4 — Appendices (Tier E)

Legacy or related whitepapers tied in for completeness.

LSDT Simulations — Layered simulation model; early analogues of AWB. → Status: placeholder

PURR Units — Primitive units; modular expansions. → Status: placeholder

CAT Theory — Complexity and transformation theory. → Status: placeholder

Sacred Numerology — Early number-structural insights; reframed into base-4 quadratic language. → Status: placeholder

Stage 5 — RAG Decks

All evidence, proofs, receipts, and audit material.

RAG_Master_IRL — All experimental/observational anchors.

RAG_Framework — Embedding mechanics, algebraic rules, AWB, UDMS.

RAG_Technical — CRT, Hodge, ALENA, code/lattice parity.

RAG_Case_Studies — NV centers, DNA base-4 networks, pinning, photonic coupling.

Stage 6 — Expansion Pool

Future slots (to draft in parallel so we save work):

Packing/Unpacking Equivalence (beyond BRS/BRM).

Compression/Decompression Equivalence.

Prime Lensing / Coprime CRT Residuals.

Superpermutation Geometry → Semantic Embedding.

✅ Deployment strategy:

Stage 1 (Tier A+B): finalize anchor claims + framework.

Stage 2: formalize technical rules that make audits work.

Stage 3: case studies to connect IRL physics/biology.

Stage 4: pull in legacy work, reframed into QCE.

Stage 5: unify RAG decks and receipts.

Stage 6: parallel-draft expansion pool topics.
