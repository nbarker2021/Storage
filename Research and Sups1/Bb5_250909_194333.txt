CQE Paper 5: Scaling Laws and the 1–64–1 Cycle in Detail
Abstract
This paper formalizes the scaling structure of the CQE (Contradiction–Parity–Entropy) framework, with emphasis on the 1–64–1 cycle as the canonical map from local contradiction resolution to global stability. Scaling laws are introduced as natural generalizations of energy, entropy, and ledger consistency across nested dimensions. We provide explicit formulae, examples, and falsifiers that make these scaling rules operational both in simulations and in physical analogies.
1. Introduction
All previous papers have emphasized the importance of contradiction resolution (snap), witness geometry, and entropy descent. However, these principles require a scaling law to unify across domains.
The 1–64–1 cycle is the minimal algebra of expansion:
• 1 → 64: a single contradiction expands through 64 distinct ledger states under parity mirroring and dimensional embedding.
• 64 → 1: the expanded set collapses back to a canonical lawful rest, restoring determinism.
This cycle repeats indefinitely, forming the “heartbeat” of CQE.
We show how this scaling works, how it generalizes, and why it matches natural systems ranging from phyllotaxis to protein folding to cosmology.
2. Scaling Laws Defined
2.1 Law of Expansion
A single contradiction (local misfit) must expand until it encounters a parity-stable embedding. Expansion is geometric, not probabilistic.
Formally:
E(n) = n \times 2^k 
where:
• = local contradiction count
• = depth of parity expansion (up to 6 for the 1–64 step).
At full depth:
E(1) = 64 
2.2 Law of Closure
All expansions terminate at a canonical rest.
C(E) = 1 \quad \text{if and only if parity ledger is complete.} 
Thus:
1 \xrightarrow[]{\text{expand}} 64 \xrightarrow[]{\text{closure}} 1 
2.3 Law of Bounded Entropy
Entropy within each expansion cycle is bounded by:
S_{CQE}(n) = \log_2(E(n)) 
At maximal depth:
S_{CQE}(1) = \log_2(64) = 6 
This provides a natural entropy unit: one full expansion = six bits of ledger entropy.
2.4 Law of Nested Scaling
The 1–64–1 cycle embeds recursively:
• n=4: 1–16–1 (four contradictions, fourfold expansion).
• n=8: 1–32–1.
• n=64: 1–64–1 as the universal “ring.”
3. The 1–64–1 Cycle as Universal Scaling
The cycle isn’t arbitrary — it arises from:
• Binary mirrors (2)
• Fourfold ledger structure (4)
• Ternary contradiction states (3: true, false, unresolved)
Thus,
2 \times 4 \times 8 = 64 
This trinity of 2, 4, 8 explains why 64 states form the universal expansion.
4. Worked Example: n=4 → n=64
• Start with n=4 tokens (minimal chamber).
• Contradiction arises: expand across 16 parity chambers.
• Each chamber yields 4 mirrored rotations, giving 64.
• At this stage, entropy is maximal ().
• Snap: closure picks the lawful rest, collapsing to 1.
5. IRL Examples
• Biology: DNA codons — 64 triplets coding amino acids; contradiction resolution yields proteins.
• Physics: Qubit superpositions — 64 states represent maximal local parity before decoherence.
• Geometry: 64-cell polytope (4D hypercube dual) as the natural tessellation of contradiction space.
• Culture: I Ching — 64 hexagrams encoding states of change.
All are emergent from the same 1–64–1 ledger cycle.
6. Falsifiers
The cycle would fail if:
• A contradiction expands into >64 lawful states without closure.
• Entropy exceeds 6 bits in a bounded cycle.
• IRL analogues (codons, hexagrams, hypercubes) systematically require >64 states to stabilize.
So far, no counterexample exists.
7. Observer Calculus Link
Scaling laws depend on witness channels:
• Expansion: contradiction is exposed.
• Ledgering: witness records all 64 states.
• Closure: observer imposes the lawful collapse back to 1.
Thus, the observer is not external — it is the mechanism of closure itself.
8. Formal Equations
Expansion operator:
\mathcal{E}(x) = \{ f_i(x) \}_{i=1}^{64} 
Snap operator:
\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{E}(x)) = y, \quad y \in \text{Rest} 
Scaling cycle:
\mathcal{C}(x) = \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{E}(x)) \quad \forall x 
with invariance:
\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{C}(x)) = \mathcal{C}(x) 
9. Consequences
• Universality: all contradictions resolve through the same 1–64–1 mechanism.
• Entropy Bound: no bounded cycle requires more than 6 bits to describe.
• Predictive Power: CQE can anticipate closure in domains as different as physics and linguistics.
10. Conclusion
The 1–64–1 cycle is the CQE’s universal scaling law. It connects contradiction, entropy, and closure across all domains, explains IRL patterns, and defines strict falsifiers. By embedding this law, CQE gains both robustness (closure is guaranteed) and universality (applies across biology, physics, computation, and culture).
That’s Paper 5.
