CQE Paper 8: Scaling Limits of Contradiction–Parity–Entropy (CQE)
Abstract
This paper establishes the scaling laws and boundary conditions of the CQE framework. While the system is universal in scope, its power is constrained by energetic, entropic, and combinatorial scaling. We show how contradictions accumulate, how parity resolves at different dimensional scales, and where failure or breakdown would occur if scaling laws are violated.
1. Introduction
CQE claims universality: any contradiction can be ledgered, paritized, and snapped into lawful rest. But how far can this stretch?
Key scaling questions:
• How does entropy grow with system size?
• Where does the ledger become computationally infeasible?
• What physical limits constrain CQE in real universes?
This paper defines the scaling function of CQE and its limits of applicability.
2. Scaling in Contradictions
2.1 Base Definition
For a system of size , the contradiction set grows as:
C(n) \sim n! 
This mirrors the growth of superpermutations and combinatorial embedding.
2.2 CQE Reduction
CQE reduces factorial growth to polynomial ledger size through lawful embedding:
L(n) \sim O(n^2) 
Ledger tracks contradictions, not permutations. Snap closure removes exponential redundancy.
3. Entropy Scaling
Define CQE entropy as:
S_{CQE}(n) = \log_2 N_{rest}(n) 
where is the number of lawful rest states at scale .
• For small : entropy grows logarithmically.
• For large : entropy saturates at the dimension of the observer’s channel.
Key law: Entropy is observer-relative; growth is bounded by channel size, not system size.
4. Energy Scaling
Energy in CQE is the work of contradiction resolution.
\Delta E(n) = \sum_{i=1}^k f(C_i \to G_i^*) 
where each contradiction resolves to lawful geometry .
Scaling behavior:
• Linear in the number of contradictions.
• Bounded by ledger compression (lawfulness reduces cost).
• Diverges only if contradictions are introduced faster than ledgering can snap them.
5. Pose and Dimension Scaling
5.1 Pose Invariance
At any , ledger outcomes must remain invariant under rephrasing or rotation:
Pose(W) \mapsto W' \quad \Rightarrow \quad L(W) = L(W') 
This ensures scalability across frames of reference.
5.2 Dimensional Limit
CQE requires a minimum of 8 dimensions (the octad). Below this, contradictions cannot ledger fully.
At higher scales, embedding requires E8 lattice-like structures:
n \to \infty \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{CQE embeds in } E_8 \otimes HP_x 
6. Practical Scaling Boundaries
• Computational:
Without CQE compression, contradictions exceed tractable compute at .
With CQE ledgering, scaling continues to before hitting practical walls.
• Physical:
Contradictions cannot resolve faster than light-crossing time of the channel.
Parity snapping is bounded by physical chirality and causality.
• Cognitive:
Human observers saturate around 7 ± 2 contradictions simultaneously (psychological channel limit).
7. Scaling Laws
7.1 1–64–1 Cycle
Every universe undergoes:
1 \to 64 \to 1 
• 1 = single contradiction.
• 64 = full exploration of outcomes.
• 1 = lawful rest.
Scaling is thus bounded but recursive: each closure resets the ledger for the next cycle.
7.2 Golden Ratio Constraint
The φ-channel ensures embedding is smooth across scales.
Scaling law:
\alpha = \frac{360^\circ}{\varphi^2} \approx 137.5^\circ 
This ensures equidistribution of contradictions; failure to obey φ leads to clustering, breakdown, or chaos.
8. Cross-Domain Scaling
• Physics: Black hole entropy maps onto CQE entropy scaling. Ledger saturation = event horizon.
• Biology: Neural channel saturation follows 7 ± 2 rule, but ledger compression enables higher cognition.
• Computation: Scaling limit matches P vs NP debate. CQE provides polynomial ledgering against exponential contradictions.
9. Falsifiers
CQE scaling would be falsified if:
• Contradiction sets cannot be ledgered into polynomial order.
• Entropy grows unbounded with system size, independent of observer channel.
• φ embedding fails to distribute contradictions evenly across a large ledger.
10. Conclusion
CQE is scalable across physical, biological, and computational domains — but within strict limits. Contradictions grow factorially, but ledgering compresses to polynomial size. Entropy scales with channel size, not universe size. Energy scales linearly with contradiction resolution.
Thus, CQE does not break physics, cognition, or computation — it reframes their limits as observer-channel constraints.
