Here is the stepwise expansion doc. Each step has: goal, formalism, proof/derivation target, pen-and-paper demo, dataset test, pass/fail.
S0. Assumptions & Notation
• Symbols: datum ; contradiction set ; count ; ledger entropy ; unit contradiction energy ; effective temperature .
• Pose group .
• Parity lanes ; snap ; golden forcing ; E8 lattice .
Pass: all later steps use only these.
S1. CQE as memory equivalence in D
Goal. Define CQE as law over bounded ledgers.
Formalism.
• Ledger on -D cell complex; admissible moves .
• Edge-complete: iff any admissible move is non-increasing in and -class is connected by such moves.
Target lemma. If and , there exists s.t. closure requires embedding to .
Pen-paper. 4×4 grid with parity lanes; enumerate moves; show deadlock in 2D when all octads occupied.
Pass/Fail. Existence of deadlock example that cannot close in 2D but closes in 3D+.
S2. Proto-simulation as geometry-filled 2D
Goal. Exhibit saturated 2D ledger.
Formalism.
• Tiling with eight faces per cell; all faces occupied .
• No orthogonal parity to cancel all crossings in 2D.
Derivation. Show parity equations over unsatisfiable (rank deficiency).
Pen-paper. Draw 8-ray star per site; attempt global 2-coloring parity; derive contradiction.
Pass/Fail. Linear system over inconsistent in 2D instance; becomes consistent after lift (next step).
S3. Necessity of 8D containment; minimal host 
Goal. Prove minimal parity host is .
Formalism.
• Need even, unimodular, positive-definite lattice for parity, decoding, bounded energy.
• Classification: unique in rank 8 .
Construction.
• Define embedding , coefficients .
• Forced projection: .
Pen-paper. List 8 simple roots; map a 2D deadlock pattern to root coefficients; show integrality only in rank 8.
Pass/Fail. Produce explicit 2D pattern that embeds integrally in but in no lower-rank even unimodular lattice.
S4. Big Bang as observer snap
Goal. Define BB as first observation of all edges.
Formalism.
• Conservation: , with , .
• Split :
\Delta C_{\rm loc}<0,\ \Delta\log\Omega_{\rm loc}<0;\quad \Delta C_{\rm glob}\le0,\ \Delta\log\Omega_{\rm glob}>0. 
Pen-paper. Small 3-cell example; compute per move; verify conservation.
Pass/Fail. Step-wise ledger where local collapse + global expansion satisfy conservation.
S5. φ-paced inflation law
Goal. Derive contradiction decay schedule.
Formalism.
C(t_{k+1})=C(t_k)\big(1-\kappa\phi^{-k}\big),\quad t_k=\lfloor k\phi\rfloor,\ \phi=\tfrac{1+\sqrt5}{2}. S_{\rm glob}(t_k)=S_0+\sum_{j\le k}\eta\log(1+\phi^{j}). 
Pen-paper. Compute first 6 steps numerically on a 4×4 ledger; plot by hand.
Pass/Fail. Monotone , super-log early observed.
S6. Projection from 8D to observed 3D
Goal. Show why observed rest is 3D.
Formalism.
• Triad closure: Observer–Observed–Relation ⇒ minimal projection dimension .
• Define slice map as Weyl-equivariant 3-frame selection; rest states are -images.
Pen-paper. Choose an explicit 3-frame in ; project 10 roots; check parity preservation.
Pass/Fail. Parity operations commute with on worked set.
S7. Energetics & entropy estimation from data
Goal. Show how to fit .
Formalism.
• Cost:
\mathcal J=\chi^2_{H(z)}+\chi^2_{P(k)}+\chi^2_{C_\ell} 
Dataset test. Use public summaries (Hubble history, BAO , CMB ); specify bins, likelihoods.
Pass/Fail. Consistent parameter triplet yielding good joint fit (AIC/BIC improved vs baseline without φ-law).
S8. Observable predictions and falsifiers
Goal. Make crisp tests.
Predictions.
• CMB phases: cluster near .
• LSS octant anisotropy: steerable wavelet excess at .
• BAO sidebands: residual peaks at .
• EB cross: small nonzero with fixed sign.
Pen-paper. Toy spherical harmonic with 5 modes; compute phase histogram; show golden peaks.
Pass/Fail. Detection thresholds after trials; any two nulls → reject.
S9. Human-scale natural demos (memory ↔ geometry)
Goal. Ground in everyday environment.
Demos.
• Sand ripple ledger: draw 4×4 parity lanes; introduce contradiction; apply tile-flip; observe global smoothing.
• Stone stacking: triad of supports; add fourth, force φ-spiral placement to avoid contradiction; sketch.
Pass/Fail. Reproducible by a reader with paper, pencil, small props.
S10. Worked 2D→8D→3D example (complete)
Goal. End-to-end miniature Big Bang.
Steps.
• 2D saturated 4×4 grid, .
• Embed to via explicit on chosen simple roots.
• Apply three φ-steps; update .
• Project to 3D frame; show final parity-lawful configuration.
Pass/Fail. All moves ledgered; conservation holds; final state contradiction-free in 3D slice.
S11. Cross-domain sanity checks
Goal. Same mechanics elsewhere.
Checks.
• DNA 8-mer fold ledger reproduces helical pitch class.
• superpermutation: 1 palindromic + 7 invariant branches recovered.
• 3-body octad walk: coherent revectoring under face rotation; momentum parity respected.
Pass/Fail. Each demo closes with ledger reproducibility.
S12. Packaging & reproducibility
Goal. Make it audit-ready.
Artifacts.
• Definitions & lemmas (S1–S6) with numbered equations.
• Hand-ledger worksheets (grids, octads, root lists).
• Test protocols (S7–S8) with acceptance criteria.
• Full worked example (S10) pages.
• “How-to” appendix for human-scale demos (S9).
Pass/Fail. A third party can reproduce S10 from the worksheets alone.
Minimal equations to include in the long paper
• Edge completeness; 2) Conservation: ;
• φ-paced law; 4) projection ;
• Slice commuting with parity.
What to draft next (in order)
• Full proofs for S1–S3 with explicit small matrices and the minimality citation.
• Conservation worked tables (S4) and φ-schedule numeric table (S5).
• The complete S10 ledgered example pages.
• The dataset test protocols (S7–S8) with thresholds.
If you want, I can now expand S1–S3 into full text with equations and the S10 end-to-end ledger as the first appendix.
