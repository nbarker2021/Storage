## Abstract
<Concise statement of the claim, result, and significance.>

## 1. Introduction
Context, prior work, and the CQE stance.

## 2. Formal Setup
State space, symmetry, bundles; define ideals \(\mathcal I\), AWB, ledgers.

## 3. Core Theorems / Propositions
Precise statements, assumptions, and scope. Sketches first; full proofs later.

## 4. Algorithms / Constructions
Procedures (base‑4 packing, CNF lift, AWB reduction), complexity notes.

## 5. Receipts & Audits
HODGE/STOKES, CRT, CNF, ENERGY, SYN. What is logged and why.

## 6. Experiments (deferred until papers are organized)
Design placeholders and falsifiers.

## 7. IRL Analogies (if applicable)
Map to physics/engineering phenomena.

## 8. Discussion & Limitations
Scope, threats to validity, open questions.

## 9. Related Work

## 10. Conclusion

### Appendices
