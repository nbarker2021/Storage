# Aletheia — Universal Claim Evidence Dossier
**Thesis:** Computation across substrates is a morphonic equilibrium (forward Morphon ↔ reverse Anti‑Morphon) constrained by a unified conservation budget ΔΦ (Noether–Shannon–Landauer), manifested as realized action in 3‑space.

## Evidence Map (from corpus & runs)

### A. Digital / Algorithmic
- **Receipts‑First & ΔΦ law:** `Aletheia_Formalization_Complete.md` (Sections I–X) — operational gate ΔΦ ≤ 0; dual rails; identity family 𝔽.
- **Scene8 governance:** Boot and CHECK beats; residual programs and ECC escalation (tile→octave→32D→64D).
- **Unibeam runs:** `unibeam_dualrail_harness.py` (v1) + Addendum; `unibeam_dualrail_harness_v2.py` (this dossier) adds numeric‑tolerant identity and fail‑closed.
- **MagicProbe:** 1D/2D percolation surrogate; mutual‑magic used as beam‑coherence order parameter.

**Claim tie‑in:** Forward/backward passes in computation are adjoints; lawful commits require reversible identity on 𝔽 and budget closure — observed in receipts and closure verdicts.

### B. Quantum / Optical
- **Magic transitions:** measurement‑only models with additive magic and mutual‑magic as order parameter (surrogate reproduced here).
- **Self‑organizing light:** optical beams sorting into stable patterns (to be linked to Scene8 optical adapter).
- **E₈/Leech embeddings:** morphon nucleus + stabilizer coat analog to RBC factorization.

**Claim tie‑in:** Quantum “magic” ≈ informational curvature; mutual‑magic peaks map to morphon coherence thresholds; optical self‑organization instantiates morphonic equilibrium in a photonic medium.

### C. Neural / Biological
- **Choice as equilibrium:** Dual rails interpret imagination (forward) vs appraisal/feedback (reverse); decision when rails agree on 𝔽.
- **snapDNA / GTG:** persistent embedding families (SNAPs) as identity carriers; GTG cycles (Genesis–Termination–Genesis) as closure loops with residual learning.

**Claim tie‑in:** Biological action as morphonic closure: rehearsal (Uni⁺), feedback inhibition (Uni⁻), commit on ΔΦ ≤ 0 & identity agreement.

### D. Ethical / Social
- **Ethics as curvature:** E1–E7 constraints (harm, autonomy, privacy, fairness, explainability) implemented as Δφ bounds.
- **Refusal as lawful outcome:** Residual programs operationalize “Not‑Reality” as repair path; receipts provide public audit.

**Claim tie‑in:** Governance rail is an Anti‑Morphon: proposed future vs mirrored audit; social action commits only on closure.

### E. Geometry / Lattice Foundations
- **Morphon formalization:** Weyl‑equivalence classes on E₈; sliced‑tori identity; identity family 𝔽 invariant under admissible words.
- **Dimensional cascade:** {16,24,32,64,…} checkpoints; 24D fuzzy edges managed by adaptive ECC; 24‑stack bundles project coherent 3D “magic” settings (MagicProbe bundles).

**Claim tie‑in:** Higher‑dimensional shells project stable 3D behaviors when morphons bundle and close.

## Concrete Artifacts and Where to Look
- **Canon:** `Aletheia_Formalization_Complete.md` (Sections I–X).  
- **Harness (v2):** `unibeam_dualrail_harness_v2.py` (numeric identity, fail‑closed).  
- **MagicProbe:** `/mnt/data/MagicProbe` and `/mnt/data/MagicProbe2D`.  
- **Scene receipts:** `unibeam_receipts.jsonl`, `unibeam_closure.json` (v1) and future v2 runs.

## Summary
Across digital, quantum/optical, neural, and social substrates, we document the same operational pattern: a forward projection and a reverse audit converge on an invariant identity with a non‑increasing ΔΦ. Where convergence fails, residual repair restores closure. This dossier aggregates the code, experiments, and formalisms demonstrating the universality claim.
