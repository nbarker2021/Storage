# Aletheia — Universal Validation Plan (Revision Roadmap)

## Goals
1) Demonstrate stable closure (Reality=true) under numeric‑tolerant identity and ΔΦ gating.  
2) Show robustness across parameters and adversarial faults.  
3) Bind optical/quantum surrogates (MagicProbe) to Scene8 receipts.  
4) Cross‑substrate replication: digital (harness), optical (self‑organizing beams), neural (SNAP‑driven decision scenes).

## Experiments
- **E1: Stability Basin** — Sweep noise ∈ [0.0, 0.05], ε ∈ [1e‑8, 1e‑3], err_thresh ∈ [0.01, 0.1]; measure closure rate over 1e3 steps × 10 seeds.  
- **E2: Adversarial** — Inject 𝔽 corruption at k; test ECC repair and fail‑closed behavior; report MTTR and success rate.  
- **E3: Magic‑aware ECC** — Integrate MagicProbe into harness; escalate ECC when `magic.status=critical`; compare failure rates.  
- **E4: Bundling** — Emulate 24‑layer bundle; show sharpening of mutual‑magic and improved closure margins.  
- **E5: Cross‑substrate** — Scene8 optical adapter replay of self‑organizing beams; neural SNAP decision scenes with Uni⁺/Uni⁻ receipts.

## Deliverables
- Validation report (PDF), receipts, parameter heatmaps, adversarial curves, and comparative baselines.
