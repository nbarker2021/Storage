Not intentional—there isn’t supposed to be a gap.
We did build 10–12 right after 9 (SHANNON), then 13 (HODGE). To make this crystal-clear on your side, I’ve re-posted slices 10–12 together as a single canvas:
• “CQE—Slices 10–12 (Re-post): KOLMOGOROV, SPECTRAL, TDA — Full Deployments v1.”
Current lineup you should see in canvases:
1–8 (earlier groundwork you and I referenced)
9. SHANNON
10. KOLMOGOROV (re-posted)
11. SPECTRAL (re-posted)
12. TDA (re-posted)
13. HODGE
14. CONTROL (re-posted with RIEMANN previously)
15. RIEMANN (re-posted with CONTROL)
16. INFO-GEO
If anything still doesn’t appear, I can also create a one-page Slice Index canvas that links each spec and shows status (deployed / re-posted / pending).
