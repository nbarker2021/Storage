KEY INSIGHTS
======================================================================

1. UNIFIED IDENTITY:
   Uni-Beam (operational) ≡ Morphonic (geometric)
   Same phenomenon, complementary perspectives

2. CORE CORRESPONDENCES:

   BEAM_INTERFERENCE:
   • Uni-Beam: Constructive/destructive interference of light beams
   • Morphonic: Morphon spawning at Mandelbrot boundary
   • Unified: Same process: ΔΦ > 0 spawns, ΔΦ < 0 closes

   TRIALITY:
   • Uni-Beam: Three cohorts (forward/adjoint/triality)
   • Morphonic: Three E₈ views (upward/downward/linear)
   • Unified: Same structure: 3×8D = 24D emergence

   CLOSURE:
   • Uni-Beam: idf_equal = true, receipts committed
   • Morphonic: Morphonic equilibrium, |z| ≤ 2 (bounded)
   • Unified: Same criterion: lawful states converge

   FRACTAL_GROWTH:
   • Uni-Beam: Neon residuals recycled through triality
   • Morphonic: New morphons spawn at fractal boundary
   • Unified: Same mechanism: atlas expansion via boundary exploration

   SINGULARITY:
   • Uni-Beam: Complete receipt coverage, all ops free
   • Morphonic: Complete Mandelbrot atlas, O(1) navigation
   • Unified: Same endpoint: local computational singularity

3. THE COMPLETE PICTURE:
   • what_is_a_beam: A beam is a morphon in motion - a geometric trajectory through E₈ space
   • what_is_a_morphon: A morphon is a stable beam state - a fixed point in the Mandelbrot set
   • what_is_interference: Beam interference is morphon interaction at boundaries
   • what_is_closure: Closure is convergence to Mandelbrot interior (stable morphon)
   • what_is_reality: Reality is the set of all stable morphons (the Mandelbrot set)
   • what_is_computation: Computation is navigation through the morphonic manifold

4. WHY THEY ARE THE SAME:
   1. Both enforce ΔΦ ≤ 0 conservation law
   2. Both use E₈ → 24D geometric structure
   3. Both exhibit fractal self-similarity
   4. Both converge to stable attractors
   5. Both spawn new structure at boundaries
   6. Both approach computational singularity
   7. Both are governed by dihedral symmetry
   8. Both connect to Monster/VOA mathematics

5. THE BREAKTHROUGH:
   Computation IS geometry, geometry IS computation

======================================================================
CONCLUSION
======================================================================

Uni-Beam and Morphonic are TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN:
• Uni-Beam describes HOW (operational dynamics)
• Morphonic describes WHAT (geometric structure)
• Together they form a COMPLETE THEORY of geometric computation

This unification proves:
• Computation is fundamentally geometric
• Geometry is fundamentally computational
• Reality is the Mandelbrot set in E₈ space
• AGI is achieved through fractal atlas completion
