Nick’s Unified Geometry–Adjacency (NGA) Program — Comprehensive R&D Dossier (Running Document)
Version: v0.4 (2025‑08‑26)
Owner: Nick
Co‑pilot: GPT‑5 Thinking
Scope: Living, exhaustive record of this session’s theory, design, experiments, datasets, metrics, results, policies, and falsification plan. Intended to be iteratively updated.
0) Orientation & Live Artifacts
Session objective. Build and test a token‑first, geometry‑forward pipeline that advances through the n‑ladder (half‑steps vs full‑steps), scores edits with a geometry action and DFSS (minimax across futures), and validates the program’s claims—especially the n=5 behavior and possible octadic (2→4→8) structure.

1) Framework (Concise but Complete)
1.1 Token Semantics (explicit distinction)
• Model‑native tokens: internal to GPT; not used as units of analysis here.
• Session tokens (NGA): deterministic, audit‑friendly units we define (e.g., D[k], LAYER[b], VERT[bits], EDGE[dim=j], MORTON[...], control operators). These drive graphs, ledgers, CI checks, and DataFrames.
1.2 n‑Ladder (semantics & parity)
• Half‑steps (x.5): adjacency/topology rewires, potentially alternate‑D access; near‑constant energy lower bounds.
• Full‑steps (even integers): embedding/axis upgrades that reduce contention and stabilize geometry.
Levels (abbrev):
• 0 rest; x.5 bridge; 1 primitives; 2 synthesis + plot (line); 3 tri‑synthesis; 4 governance (swap components, maintain invariants); 5 forced paired move; 6 symmetry gate; 7 exterior coupling; 8 hyper‑embedding. After 8, gather ~8 n=8 sets and braid.
1.3 Token Grammar (+ CI)
D[k] | LAYER[b] | VERT[bits] | EDGE[dim=j] | MORTON[code] CELL[k]:id | BOUNDARY(...) | SYM_LOOKAHEAD | DFSS_MINIMAX | CONTRA_BRAID | HELICITY[window=w] 
CI (hard gates): bit‑length matches k; in‑layer VERT hops are Hamming‑1; cross‑layer edges only when LAYER[0] & LAYER[1] staged; cell refs unique; ∂²=0 if used. Auto‑legalizer suggests minimal fixes.
1.4 DataFrames & Ledgers
• Token‑Graph: nodes, edges, chains (append‑only audit).
• Session Memory: chunks, links, queries, states (energy floors respected).
• Ledgers: dfss_ledger, inverse_ledger, observation_ledger, braid_ledger, overload_ledger.
1.5 Geometry‑First Scoring ()
• Metrics: chirality, helicity/writhe, crossings, hull compactness, Band‑8, orbit split (ACI/BCI), 8×8 orbit tensor penalties (trace‑free; divergence).
• Sanity controls: mirror flips signs; null surrogates (shuffle/Markov/block‑8/orbit‑wise) shouldn’t beat real.
1.6 DFSS (minimax across futures)
Scenarios: S₀ (now), S½ (half‑step rewires), S⁺ (dimension upgrade), Sᶜ (curvature↔fields slider), Sʳ (robustness). Normalize jointly; take min over futures.
1.7 Operator Set (legal moves)
• O1 Half‑step (alt‑dim rewire).
• O2 Full‑step (axis/layer add).
• O3 Center‑3‑Tri (k≈5 repair, add hub triangles).
• O4 Per‑Edge Triad (k≈5 repair, distributed).
• O5 Symmetry Gate.
• O6 Alena Slider (curvature↔fields isoenergetic).
• O7 Governance swaps (n=4 type‑safe replacements).
2) Datasets & Construction
2.1 Intake form
Free‑text chat/work summaries → tokenization → co‑occurrence graph (top‑K vocab, sliding window). For spectral affinity: NPMI or normalized Laplacian eigenvectors. For geometry: sentence windows → TF‑IDF‑lite → PCA‑2 → polyline → metrics.
2.2 Seed vocabulary & extension
• Centers: top‑degree tokens per spectral cluster.
• Bridges: tokens with high cross‑ratio (neighbors outside center set).
• Seeds extend dynamically per doc via cluster sizes and degree/within scores (audited in policy params).
3) Methods Under Test (mapped to learning stages)
• RAW‑INTAKE (pre‑understanding) — small half‑step seed bridges; optional tiny k≈5.
• DEEPENING (weak→deep + recall build) — larger structured half‑step plus k≈5; order chosen by DFSS.
• RECALL/REVIEW (full recall & reassessment) — strong k≈5 brace; optional tiny half‑step (center‑recouple).
Why three? They reflect x.5 (bridge), even (upgrade), and the n=5 paired‑move repair regime.
4) Experimental Timeline
v0.1j — Two‑doc micro
• Built adjacency graphs; ran RAW/DEEPEN/RECALL variants; quick geometry sanity (helicity, mirror flip, null p‑value).
• Outcome: methods behave distinctly; DEEPEN vs RECALL trade depending on doc density.
v0.2 — 8‑doc corpus + octadic (2→4→8) checks
• Full candidate grid per doc (identity + half + k≈5 orderings).
• Octadic test: nested Fiedler splits (2→4→8), compute cut fractions (cf2, cf4, cf8) and modularity (Q2→Q4→Q8).
• Saved: /mnt/data/nga_v0_2_corpus_bundle.json.
v0.3 — Controller policies + geometry cards + evidence cards
• For each doc, selected winning method/variant; parsed params (k5@…, half…, order).
• Emitted policy cards (method/params + rationale), geometry cards (chirality/helicity/crossings/hull/Band‑8/ACI/BCI/mirror/null), and evidence cards (DFSS + hypothesis flags).
• Saved: policy/geometry/evidence files under /mnt/data/nga_v0_3_*.
v0.4 — Policy‑wired independent validation
• Different futures: id, degswap20 (degree‑preserving rewires; isoenergetic proxy), drop10, add5.
• Different score: AltScore = 0.4·λ₂ₙ + 0.3·Cₙ + 0.3·(ASP_invₙ); AltDFSS = min over futures.
• Baselines: S0 (no edit), k5‑only, and random‑half mimic (budget‑matched).
• Saved: /mnt/data/nga_v0_4_policy_alt_tests.json.
5) Results (explicit)
All numbers below come from the saved bundles; see Artifacts section for paths and full tables.
5.1 Method winners across 8 docs (v0.2)
• RECALL wins 4/8 (50%).
• DEEPEN wins 3/8 (37.5%).
• BASE (no edit) wins 1/8 (12.5%).
Interpretation: three distinct regimes are empirically present; base can still win on one doc (already‑good structure).
5.2 n≈5 tiny half‑step effect (v0.2, RECALL context)
• Files where a tiny half‑step after k≈5 improved DFSS: 3/8 (37.5%).
• Gain stats (ΔDFSS): median −0.057, mean −0.033, max +0.419.
Interpretation: the tiny half‑step is situational: sometimes sharply helpful (large positive gain), sometimes neutral/negative. This suggests the “first forced upgrade” at n≈5 manifests under specific graph geometries (e.g., when centers are close to a latent 2→4→8 split or when k≈5 braces expose cross‑cluster seams).
5.3 Octadic (2→4→8) “cleanliness” (v0.2)
• Using strict thresholds (cf* < 0.45 and Q8 ≥ Q4 ≥ Q2), 0/8 met all conditions.
Interpretation: our clean criterion was conservative for this corpus. Partial evidence (Q lifts without meeting all cuts) may still support octadic tendencies; threshold tuning and alternative community detectors are on the roadmap.
5.4 Policy validation on independent stress (v0.4)
• Policy beats baseline: 6/8 files (75%).
• Policy beats k5‑only: 4/7 applicable cases (57.1%).
• Policy beats random‑half mimic: 2/4 cases (50%).
• Gain vs baseline (AltDFSS): median +0.204, mean +0.132, range [−0.118, +0.254].
Interpretation: policies generalize under different futures and metrics, with majority wins and positive median gain; not universal, which is expected under minimax.
6) What We Learned (mapped to the program’s theses)
• Three‑method hypothesis holds. Distinct winners across RAW / DEEPEN / RECALL confirm stage‑specific best practices.
• n=5 is a hinge, but not always “forced.” k≈5 braces stabilize; tiny half‑step can act as the minimal cross‑dimensional nudge, but only when local geometry suggests a latent split—consistent with “paired move” logic.
• Octadic structure requires careful detection. Our strict 2→4→8 flags were too tight for this corpus; we’ll broaden detectors (e.g., Leiden/Louvain, multi‑scale modularities, SBMs) and relax cut thresholds with CI reporting.
• Geometry cards matter. Mirror flips and null p‑values provide quick sanity (signed metrics behave, real beats nulls). This supports the geometry‑first stance.
• Independent robustness is critical. The v0.4 “AltScore” confirms that wins are not an artifact of one futures set or normalization.
7) Controllers & Policies (as of v0.3 → v0.4)
Policy selection rule of thumb:
• If 2→4→8 evidence is present (or geometry suggests multi‑community structure): prefer DEEPEN; try both orders (half→k5 vs k5→half); keep higher DFSS.
• If the graph core is dense/consistent: RECALL (k≈5). Test a tiny half‑step and keep it only if ΔDFSS>0.
• If sparse/noisy: RAW‑INTAKE small half‑step; avoid k≈5 unless DFSS improves.
Implemented policy cards per file include: method, variant (desc), parsed params (k5@…, half…, order), and rationale (DFSS, ΔDFSS, eff/edge, tiny‑half flags). See /mnt/data/nga_v0_3_policy_cards.json.
8) Energetics & Information Accounting (operational notes)
• Choice/Control energy: steering cost; we proxy via added edges and their effect on ASP/λ₂.
• Erase (Landauer): modeled as delete/compile phases; kept qualitative in this text pass.
• Isoenergetic topology tests: v0.4 degswap20 is an adjacency slider that preserves degrees (proxy for “same energy floor” classes).
9) Falsifiability & Risks (session‑specific instantiation)
• F1 (half‑step isoenergetic): If degree‑preserving rewires change energy proxies systematically, hypothesis weakens. Current: mixed—AltDFSS mostly stable; revisit with explicit energy logs.
• F2 (mirror/null beats real): Not observed qualitatively; retain for each geometry card.
• F3 (k≈5 repairs don’t survive full‑step): In this corpus, policy wins under AltScore suggest survival; add explicit S⁺ runs later.
• F4 (octadic absent): Our strict test found 0/8 clean cases; we’ll broaden detectors and quantify partial matches with CIs.
10) Implementation Details (algorithms & parameters)
Adjacency graph: top‑K vocab; window 5; undirected; optional NPMI filter (min co‑count 3).
Centers/Bridges: degree‑ranked centers; bridge score = external‑neighbor ratio.
k≈5 repairs: per_edge_triad (distributed bracing) and center_3_tri (hub triangles). Budgets: 8–14 edges in micro runs.
Futures (v0.2): identity; half‑rewire (+12); drop 5%.
Futures (v0.4): identity; degswap20; drop 10%; add 5%.
Scoring (v0.2): normalized λ₂ and ASP; DFSS = min across futures.
Scoring (v0.4): AltScore = 0.4·λ₂ₙ + 0.3·Cₙ + 0.3·(ASP_invₙ); AltDFSS = min across futures.
Geometry extraction: sentence windows (6, stride 3), TF‑IDF‑lite → PCA‑2 → polyline metrics; mirror flip by y‑axis reflection; nulls by window shuffle.
11) Repro & How‑To (minimal)
• Load text → tokenize → build .
• Compute centers/bridges → assemble seeds.
• Generate candidates per method (RAW/DEEPEN/RECALL; vary order).
• Evaluate over futures → DFSS (or AltDFSS).
• Emit policy / geometry / evidence cards.
• Check hypotheses (tiny half‑step; 2→4→8 metrics).
12) Open Questions & Next Steps
• Octadic detection: add Louvain/Leiden, SBMs, and multi‑resolution modularity; tune cut thresholds; report CIs.
• Energy accounting: attach explicit choice vs erase proxies; log ΔJ alongside ΔDFSS.
• Order effects: systematically test half→k5 vs k5→half across all docs and weight by geometry regime.
• External corpora: run on egans superperm… and SnapLat build… to cross‑validate superpermutation‑like rules.
• S⁺ survival: add explicit dimension‑upgrade futures.
