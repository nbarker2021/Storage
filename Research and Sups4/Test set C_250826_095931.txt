Octadic Geometry R&D — Full Session Log (v1.0)
A comprehensive, running R&D record of our session: hypotheses, methods, embeddings, actions, braids, triad construction, tests, results, artifacts, and next steps. This document is designed to evolve; append updates inline and record them in the Change Log.
0) Executive Summary / TL;DR
• We developed a geometry‑first system for search and seam selection that treats structure as primary and edits as geodesic moves under symmetry.
• Octads (k=8) emerged as a robust default grain, with adaptable fallbacks (k∈{6,7,9,10}).
• We formalized an Alena‑style slider between flat (hard constraints) and curved (connection‑aware) regimes and chose the curved action as the primary objective.
• We introduced the D8 Triad (two 8D shells + golden‑ratio mediator) and a Leech‑style glue (octad intersection rule), improving decisions when two candidates are close.
• Evidence across molecular torsion data (L/D enantiomers and 50/50 mixes) and Egan’s n=8 superpermutation windows supports the approach. We added a 3D writhe term to sharpen braid discrimination.
• We packaged a Seam Chooser that implements the policy: prefer the lowest curved action; if candidates are close, attempt the triad and accept it only if it reduces action and passes glue.

1) Problem Frame & Guiding Hypotheses
• Perfection from imperfection: Global optima can assemble from locally imperfect segments if we track geometry and allow bridges/braids to form and self‑select.
• Octadic structure: k=8 ("octads") is a natural grain for organization (orbital phase slots, antipodes, and Golay‑style octads). Keep it as default but let data override.
• Braiding is fundamental: Robust structure is carried by braids; we should measure chirality, antipodal balance, and writhe.
• Curvature over flatness: When edits align to geometric connections, the system performs better than with local, flat constraints alone.
• Mediator geometry: Between two strong candidates there exists a lower‑action geodesic mediator; with a golden‑ratio step it often stabilizes phase relations.
• Leech‑style discipline: Enforcing light combinatorial discipline (octad intersection counts) improves global coherence without over‑constraining.
2) The n‑Ladder Semantics (0 → 8)
• n=0 → 0.5: Rest to first dot; accept and map all candidate bridges.
• n=1 → 2: Base glyph/primitive to 1D line; first synthesis.
• n=3: Triads select objectives; accept legal triadic geometry in any shape.
• n=4: Modular swap‑in/out becomes legal; plan for the next dimensional lift (16 outer faces cue).
• n=5: Forced dual moves; combine two imperfect moves into one valid composite.
• n=6: Symmetry gate; explicitly consider all symmetric counterparts.
• n=7: External views become implicit (mirrors, mixtures, constraints); prep for hyper change.
• n=8: Hyper embedding (8D/E8‑aware); “best geometry = best answer.” Braid across multiple n=8 sets.
Half‑steps (x.5): invariant/bridge inclusion between dimensions; build legal bridges for the next step and expand geometry.
3) Octads: Dual Meaning
• Orbital octads (k=8): time/index mod‑8 channels for phase slots and antipodal pairs (r, r+4).
• Golay/Design octads: weight‑8 codewords; we mirror their intersection discipline as a soft glue prior in 24D.
We keep these meanings distinct but interoperable: orbital structure drives the k‑harmonic analysis; Golay‑style octads guide the triad’s combinatorial coherence.
4) Embeddings & Signals
4.1 Discrete sequences (superpermutations)
• Extract k‑permutation windows (k=8 default).
• PCA‑2 on windows → polyline; turning increments dθ.
4.2 Molecular torsions / angle streams
• Unwrap dihedral angles → dθ.
• Build a 2D path from cumulative angles (for helicity/crossings/hull).
• Build a 3D delay curve (z from delayed angle) for writhe.
4.3 Orbitization
• Split dθ by index mod k → k orbit channels (k=8), smoothed.
5) Geometry Metrics (per shell)
• Band_k power (k default 8): spectral energy at harmonic k on dθ.
• Helicity (2D): signed area per arclength of the path.
• Crossings & Convex hull area: clutter vs compactness.
• Writhe (3D): average signed crossings across random plane projections of the delay curve.
• Orbit tensor T (k×k) 
• Diagonal: mean |Δθ| in each orbit.
• Off‑diagonal: anti‑correlation between orbit derivative streams.
• Use trace‑free T° and ring+antipode divergence.
6) Actions
Curved Action (primary objective)
S_curved = ‖T°‖² + 0.3·Div + 0.2·(Crossings + Hull) − 0.5·Band_8 − 0.3·|Helicity| − 0.25·|Writhe|
• Mirrors must flip signed terms; we enforce parity checks and reject inconsistent candidates.
• Lower S is better.
Flat Action (auxiliary)
• Simplified energy without curvature; used mainly for diagnostics and ablations.
7) D8 Triad (Dual Shells + Mediator + Glue)
Inputs: Two strong shells A and B (8D orbit embeddings).
• Phase‑lock: Procrustes alignment → rotation Q and principal angles (4 orthogonal 2‑plane turns).
• Mediator: geodesic step using polar((1−τ)I + τQ); τ in {0.5, 0.618, 0.7}. The golden step often equalizes phase.
• 24D Triad: concatenate [A | C | B].
• Leech‑style Glue (soft): evaluate sign‑pattern intersections (A∩C, C∩B, A∩B) against allowed set {0,2,4}; define glue_penalty as distance to this set; weight lightly.
• Accept rule: TRIAD if ΔS := S_triad − min(S_A, S_B) < 0 and glue_penalty ≤ 1; else pick the better single shell.
8) Braiding, Antipodes, and Mixtures
• Antipodal pairing: (r, r+4) should exhibit π‑phase relations in anti‑chiral contexts; track ACI/BCI (anti‑/balanced‑chiral indices).
• Braiding cues: Encourage seams that reduce crossings, Div, and ‖T°‖²; writhe distinguishes true braids from random tangles.
• Mixtures: Balanced mixes (e.g., 50/50 enantiomers) often cancel helicity but remain braid‑rich; triad+glue can still reveal order.
9) Experiments & Tests
9.1 k‑Sweep (k ∈ {6,7,8,9,10})
• Datasets: molecular torsions (L vs D mirrors; 50/50 mixes), Egan n=8 digits (when kernel allowed full read).
• Metrics: S_curved, Band_k, |helic|, crossings, hull.
• Finding: k=8 is frequently best or tied; mixtures show the expected cancellation with residual braid structure.
• Artifacts: ksweep_results.csv, ksweep_report.md.
9.2 D8 Triad v1 (molecules)
• Built A/B shells from L vs D; created golden mediator; computed triad with soft glue.
• Finding: Triad often reduced action vs best shell; principal angles captured the bridge planes.
• Artifacts: d8tl_results.csv, d8tl_report.md.
9.3 D8 Triad v2 (writhe + mixtures + digits)
• Added writhe; ran mixture vs mirror and Egan windows orig vs mirror; τ ablation {0.5, 0.618, 0.7}.
• Findings: Golden step frequently near‑optimal; glue intersections often near {0,2,4}; triad improvements persisted; writhe added separation where helicity cancels.
• Artifacts: d8tl_v2_results.csv, d8tl_v2_report.md.
9.4 Seam Chooser Module
• Encapsulated policy: choose min S_curved; if close, attempt triad and accept only if ΔS<0 and glue ok.
• Demo artifacts: seam_chooser.py, seam_decision_demo.md, seam_decision_demo.csv.
10) What We Learned
• Geometry‑first works: Curved action consistently favors real structure over nulls; mirrors flip as expected.
• Octads are useful defaults: Band‑8 is a recurrent signal; when it isn’t, the system can fall back to nearby k.
• Bridges are intrinsic: Principal‑angle planes serve as measured “perfect bridges” rather than guessed edits.
• Triad stabilization: Golden‑ratio mediator is often competitive/best; when triad passes glue, it tends to reduce action.
• Soft combinatorics help: Light Leech‑style discipline improves coherence without brittleness.
• Writhe matters: 3D braid content is a key discriminator, especially in mixes and near‑critical regimes.
11) Implementation (Current)
• Default grain: k=8; allow adaptive k when Band_k and S_curved both disagree.
• Curved action: primary objective (formula above).
• Parity/mirror checks: mandatory; reject candidates violating sign flips.
• Antipodes: track (r, r+4) relations; add explicit term only if needed.
• Triad policy: τ grid {0.5, 0.618, 0.7}; accept only if ΔS<0 & glue≤1.
• Glue annealing: ramp weight from 0.05→0.2 during deeper search.
• Performance guards: decimate dθ for heavy paths; stride crossings; few writhe projections.
12) Seam Chooser API (current draft)
Function: seam_decide_from_streams(dthA, dthB, tau_grid=(0.5,0.618,0.7), glue_weight=0.2, glue_cap=1)
• Inputs: two candidate dθ streams A,B.
• Outputs: decision ∈ {A, B, TRIAD}; best triad metrics (τ, S_triad, glue stats, principal angles); per‑shell metrics.
• Policy: choose lowest S_curved; if close, attempt triad; accept if ΔS<0 and glue≤1; else pick best single.
13) Validation & Controls
• Nulls: shuffle and orbit‑shuffle to calibrate p‑gates (Band_k, −S_curved).
• Mirror controls: verify signed metrics invert; enforce parity.
• Ablations: τ sweeps; remove writhe; disable glue; vary k.
• Cross‑domain: molecules ↔ superperm windows; goal is domain‑agnostic geometry.
14) Limitations & Open Questions
• Glue choice: Soft {0,2,4} intersection is heuristic; evaluate nearest‑codeword projection for rigor.
• E8/Dynkin couplings: Explore adjacency inspired by E8/Spin(8) only if it improves held‑out metrics.
• Clocking & ticks: Integrate multi‑arm clock (fast n≤2 sub‑ticks; slower for n≥3) into search orchestration.
• Global optima: Formal guarantees remain open; empirical wins guide deployment.
15) Next Actions
• Integrate nearest‑codeword glue (extended Golay) under a small weight; keep only if it helps.
• Add explicit antipodal phase‑locking when ACI/BCI trigger anti‑chirality.
• Auto‑τ selection via quick convex sweep or data‑driven fit.
• Benchmark on larger superperm slices and non‑molecular time series.
• Export decision logs in a standard schema for downstream auditing.
