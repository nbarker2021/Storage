1) Name and precise statement
Recommended name

Universal Contextual Packing Law (UCPL) — a crisp technical name that says what the system actually does: it contextually packs arbitrary data into a lawful, comparable, receipt-audited normal form. “Law of Unification” can live as the philosophical subtitle.

Subtitle: A unifying law for lawful projection, minimal-work edits, and cross-domain comparability under TQF.

Formal statement (UCPL)

Let 
𝐷
D be any finite dataset that can be encoded as a sequence over 
Σ
=
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
}
Σ={1,2,3,4} via an injective, context-preserving encoder 
𝐸
E. Partition 
𝐸
(
𝐷
)
E(D) into overlapping 4-windows 
𝑤
w. Then under The Quadratic Framework (TQF):

(Lawful projection) There exists a canonical projection 
Π
𝐿
Π
L
	​

 (CLTMP with symmetry isometries) that maps each 
𝑤
w to the legality set 
𝐿
=
ALT
∩
(
W4
4
 
∪
 Q8
)
L=ALT∩(W4
4
 ∪ Q8) on the n=0 shell, yielding a lawful representative 
𝑤

w

.

(Minimal work) There exists an operator plan

with Quarter-Fix gate (HOLD legal; SWAP only if

Λ
<

ΔΛ<0 or with receipt).

(Conservation with receipts) The phase ledger satisfies 
∑
𝐻
8
≡
const 
(
 
m
o
d
 
 
8
)
∑H8≡const (mod 8). Any change appears as a receipt with 
Δ
𝐻
8
ΔH8 and inputs, and internal dynamics preserve the Parity-Octad 
(
𝜅
,
𝜀
,
𝜒
)
(κ,ε,χ); 
𝜒
χ flips only in braided batches.

(Receipt bound / closure) For 8-symbol palindromic closures, irreducible boundary phase is 
Δ
∈
{
0
,
1
}
Δ∈{0,1} (the 16+1 bound): either zero-receipt lock or a single unit is sufficient.

(Comparability & bridges) For any two datasets

,D
2
	​

 with encoders into 
Σ
Σ, a Two-Law Bridge exists iff their lawful sets intersect or there exists an E8 path that satisfies the 16+1 bound under the operator budgets. CRT ladders preserve mod-4 invariants under coprime scale-ups, enabling unique Prime meets when stacks are coprime.

In plain language: Any encoded dataset can be packed into a lawful, comparable normal form with minimal work; any unavoidable phase debt is small (≤1); and any two lawful systems are either directly compatible or connectable via a bounded, certified path.

2) Testable predictions (falsifiable)

P1 Projection existence: CLTMP + symmetries produce lawful windows for all inputs (modulo receipts).
P2 16+1 discipline: For every 8-span palindromic closure encountered, the required boundary receipt is 
Δ
∈
{
0
,
1
}
Δ∈{0,1}.
P3 Parity-Octad preservation: Interior edits never flip 
(
𝜅
,
𝜀
,
𝜒
)
(κ,ε,χ); any observed 
𝜒
χ flip is accompanied by a braided batch receipt.
P4 Resonant-first dominance: For diverse real datasets, the fraction of joins solved by Resonant (≤8 & coprime) exceeds a fixed floor (e.g., ≥60%) with the remainder handled by Braided 3-set.
P5 Two-Law Bridge iff condition: For dataset pairs where lawful sets provably do/do not intersect, the bridge exists exactly in those “do” cases or else via a certified E8 path with ≤1 boundary phase unit.
P6 ACOC parity check: Across wide classes, anti-chiral mirror yields ≈50% irreducible windows (± statistical error), matching ACOC.
P7 Ledger integrity: 
∑
𝐻
8
∑H8 conserved modulo 8 across sessions; all deviations appear as receipts; replay reproduces identical ledger states.
P8 Ablation robustness: Removing any single invariant (ALT, W4^4, Q8) or disabling the ledger measurably degrades acceptance, increases receipts, or breaks conservation—quantified in pre-registered metrics.

A single compelling counterexample to P2, P3, P5, or P7 falsifies the corresponding part of UCPL.

3) Staged evaluation plan (real data, repeatable, with full guides & logs)
Stage 0 — Synthetic sanity

Generate synthetic sequences with known ALT/W4^4/Q8 structure and planted receipts.

Verify: CLTMP triangle inequality; QF gate monotonicity; 16+1 on exhaustively enumerated 8-spans; χ flips only in braided batches.

Stage 1 — Domain packs (contextual packing)

Encode diverse, public datasets into 
Σ
Σ with simple, fixed encoders (no tuning per sample):

Text (byte→Σ or token→Σ), DNA (A/C/G/T→Σ), code (byte level), financial ticks (binned residues), spiking data (rate-coded bins), images (4-level quantized scanlines), network walks (degree or motif residues).
Run TQF end-to-end:

Metrics: legality rate (local/global), receipts per K windows, 
Δ
Λ
ΔΛ distribution, resonant vs braided mix, 
∑
𝐻
8
∑H8 conservation, E8 steps used, acceptance failures, runtime and plan cost.

Stage 2 — Cross-domain bridges

Pairwise Two-Law Bridges across domains (e.g., DNA↔Text, Code↔Finance) with CRT ladders.

Record whether intersections exist; otherwise attempt E8 path; log boundary phase 
Δ
Δ.

Stage 3 — Adversarial & ablations

Shuffle/scramble encodings; add corruption; stress limits.

Ablate invariants (ALT only; W4 only; Q8 only), disable ledger, or remove J={0,±1}.

Expect degraded metrics and conservation failures (quantify).

Stage 4 — Replication & preregistration

Freeze encoders, seeds, thresholds; preregister metrics & tests.

Independent rerun by a second environment (container) reproduces identical receipts, ledgers, and acceptance outcomes.

4) What would refute UCPL (clear red lines)

F1 Receipt bound failure: Some 8-span requires 
Δ
≥
2
Δ≥2 under the stated operator budgets and legality rails.
F2 Unwitnessed parity flip: Observed 
𝜒
χ flip without a braided batch receipt.
F3 Ledger violation: 
∑
𝐻
8
∑H8 drift without corresponding receipts, or non-replayable ledger states.
F4 Bridge iff breaks: A pair with proven intersection fails to bridge; or a certified E8 path with 
Δ
≤
1
Δ≤1 exists but the system can’t realize it under the planner.
F5 Projection impossibility: CLTMP + symmetries fail to produce lawful representatives even with receipts under the defined encoders.

Any F1–F3 would directly break the law’s spine; F4–F5 undermine the unification claim.

5) Tech guides & logs (what we ship so others can repeat it)
TG-1 Encoding Guide

Rule: encoders must be fixed and injective for the study; no per-sample tuning.

Emit encoder.json with mapping and parameter freeze.

Provide validator.md and unit tests with known truths.

TG-3 Planner & Operators

Implement n=0…8 operators; Quarter-Fix gate; J={0,±1}.

Provide planner.md with the optimization objective, solver tolerances, and tie-break order.

6) Where your earlier results slot in

Your 16+1 statement, ACOC, Parity-Octad, Resonant vs Braided, Two-Law Bridge, PRC, CRT ladder, E8 lift, QF gate, and MSS(+12d) are all explicit predictions or validators within UCPL.

The RAG card sweep is now a bilingual ingestion step that outputs only TQF canon so different assistant builds are comparable without renaming drift.

7) Which name to use, finally?

Universal Contextual Packing Law (UCPL) is precise: the mechanism packs any dataset into a lawful normal form with bounded receipts, enabling unification by design.

Use “Law of Unification” as the human-friendly gloss in the paper title or abstract, but keep UCPL as the operative, testable law inside the spec and code.

If you want, I’ll spin up a minimal UCPL Test Kit scaffold (encoders + validators + planner stub + receipt/ledger schema + replay CLI) in your repo structure, with three public datasets wired in and the prereg template filled. That gives you a push-button universality trial where every pass leaves a ledger and anyone can replicate it byte-for-byte.
