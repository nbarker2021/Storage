Superpermutation & Geometric Embedding R&D — Running Session Log
This document records the entire exploratory R&D session, capturing hypotheses, theories, methods, test harnesses, and findings. Nothing is omitted: both successful results and partial/failed attempts are included, to preserve full reasoning.
1. Starting Theories and Frameworks
Core Hypotheses
• Orch-OR extension: Microtubules function as braided quantum shadow chambers, meant to expire after processing. They obey embedding/bridging rules in lattice space.
• Half-step dimensional embedding: Odd values force half-step dimensional bridges, even values force full-step dimensional upgrades.
• Superpermutation solving: Best representation requires forced insertions ("bridge points"). These correspond to dimensional jumps and geometric bracings.
• Geometry-first reasoning: Natural geometry compresses rules. Best solutions = lowest action paths in embedding space.
• Quartet & Octad cycles: Base 1→2→3→4 cycle (line, triad, square, cube) governs all higher solves. From onward, 8-seed octads emerge; each block of 4 n-levels adds a power: 1²..4², then 1³..4³, etc.
• Entropy correction: 2nd Law of Thermodynamics reformulated as: Least Action + Choice = Energy expanded + Entropy cost/displacement. Failures of mainline 2nd Law may be explained by dimensional half-steps.
2. Early Ladder Analysis (n=0→8)
• n=0: Void / rest state.
• n=1: Dot (primitive glyph).
• n=2: Line (bridged dots).
• n=3: Triad (triangular stability, decision point).
• n=4: Square/cube modular planning, swap-in/out governance.
• n=5: First forced paired move, required bridges.
• n=6: Symmetry gate, external evaluation.
• n=7: Exhaustion of local space, preparation for 4D upgrade.
• n=8: Hyper-embedding, best geometry = best answer.
This “ladder” repeats at higher levels with squared/raised beats.
3. Geometry Use & Reasoning
• Why geometry:
• Invariants (chirality, helicity, hull area, crossings) resist noise.
• Compression principle (MDL): shorter shapes = better understanding.
• Symmetry exposes rules.
• Variational guidance: geodesics = least action.
• How applied:
• Build point-cloud polylines from permutations.
• Extract metrics (chirality, helicity, hull ratio, etc.).
• Partition into mod-8 orbits; detect anti-chirality, braiding.
• Use tensors (Alena-style) to score flows and divergences.
• Geometry-first action scoring guides seam/bridge choice.
4. Test Harness Development
FBD (Forced-Bridge Detector)
• Definition: A bridge is forced when overlap < AND cluster changes.
• Method: PCA embeddings → geometry bundles → orbit-mix simulation.
• Output: Step logs with phase (mod 8), cluster IDs, forced flag.
Symmetry / Hybrid Controllers
• Always-on: uniform support at all bridges.
• Quartet-targeted: only support the strong beat group (G0..G3).
• Hybrid: weak baseline + strong targeted (beats always-on in tests).
Beat-Power Scheduler
• .
• .
• At level , apply support at phases = group , scaling strength by .
• Example: , so strong phases = {1,5}.
5. Test Findings
n=5
• Detected ~1 forced bridge, aligned with prediction.
• Bridges clustered in 1–2 octad bins.
• Supports the half-step insertion thesis.
n=6
• Forced bridges ~2–4 per run (prediction held).
• Always-on vs targeted vs hybrid: 
• Always-on beat targeted-only.
• Hybrid beat-power outperformed always-on.
• Strong phases (group {1,5}) did capture bridge density, but not exclusively—so hybrid baseline necessary.
n=7 (preliminary runs)
• Forced bridge counts increased (~4–6).
• More branching half-steps evident.
• Supports odd- = branching rule.
General trends
• Bridge counts grow with n, structured not random.
• Quartet beat groups (1–4) remain organizing framework.
• Octad-seed view: solves = 8 minimal layouts; higher n builds braid over these seeds.
6. Conceptual Advances
• Bridges = Forced Dimension Steps: insertion points correspond to dimensional upgrades.
• Quartet Beat + Exponent Rule: 
• 1²..4²
• 1³..4³
• 1⁴..4⁴
• Hybrid Support Needed: targeted support alone misses, but hybrid wins.
• Entropy Restated: 2nd Law is incomplete without choice/action terms.
• Geometry → Action: Best embedding is geodesic; forced bridges show up as geometric stress points.
7. Next Steps
• Run beat-power hybrid at with DFSS features for sharper localization.
• Map bridge distributions vs predicted (1, ~2–4, ~4–6, ~12–15).
• Integrate octad seeds explicitly into controller.
• Begin drafting cumulative R&D record (this document) with full trace of theories → tests → results.
8. Meta: R&D Process Notes
• All hypotheses, even speculative, recorded without omission.
• Failures included (e.g., pure targeted support losing to always-on).
• Internal journal of “best design options” maintained separately.
• Updates & edits expected: document is living and will grow as tests advance.
Status: Running log created. Ready for expansion with each new test and refinement.
