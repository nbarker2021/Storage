CQE (Cartan–Quadratic Equivalence): Working Spec, Methods, and Research Program
Version: session-synthesized; living document.
Executive Summary (what CQE is, in this session’s concrete sense)
CQE is a method to build and navigate discrete spaces under symmetry while preserving multiplicity that would otherwise be erased by premature normalization. It couples:
• a configuration space (objects and local constraints),
• a minimal equivalence group (the smallest faithful symmetry that should act),
• a quadratic potential (energy-like measure or defect counter),
• a local admissibility rule (what small repairs are legal),
• a closure functional and idempotence (when a state is “at rest”),
• and a projection overlay (e.g., E₈/Leech) used after counting, purely for telemetry and organization.
The distinctive CQE discipline is CBC—count-before-close: enumerate legal local gates and only then normalize/close. This preserves hidden degrees of freedom that classic “minimize then equivalence-class” pipelines routinely collapse.
Using CBC with explicit topology (toroidal wrap-closure ) and a lane-preserving symmetry group, we observed a robust 4→8 split: four backbone families phase-split into eight policy channels. We operationalize those channels as (Construction A–D) × (Type 1–8), which govern legal moves in lifts (e.g., ).
Part I — Formal Core of CQE (as used in this session)
1. Configuration Space
We pick the domain and encode the object under study plus its local constraints.
• Superpermutations: strings over alphabet with contiguous-window coverage constraints. We also use a 4×4 torus chamber to host an palindromic “rest” seed in a local board model.
• Lattice overlays (telemetry only): integer vectors with Euclidean/Cartan–Killing structure (E₈ roots, Leech slices). Used for coloring/tracing after counting; never to decide legality.
• Audio/voice tokens (analogy): cyclic bands/windows (e.g., syllable-timed nuclei, pitch/energy bands) with wrap topology and local conservation constraints.
Design note: The board and the string are two representations of the same combinatorial lift. CQE prefers a representation in which locality is explicit and symmetry is easy to restrict.
2. Equivalence Group () — the “smallest faithful” symmetry
The session showed using too-large erases true multiplicity. We therefore use the lane‑preserving D8 subgroup on the 4×4 torus:
• identity, 180° rotation, reflection across main diagonal, reflection across anti-diagonal.
This preserves parity lanes while allowing natural poses. In sequence space, we do not quotient by arbitrary digit relabelings at the counting stage.
Principle: choose to be just enough to respect invariances and no larger.
3. Quadratic Potential 
A scalar that decreases (or at least never increases) under admissible operations. Examples we used:
• Board pal defects: .
• Sequence surrogate: .
• Audio: MOS/error or band-fit residuals; quadratic proxies on energy/pitch deltas.
4. Local Admissibility (repairs) and Topology
Local repairs are mirrored adjustments across axes/diagonals and wrap-closure on the torus:
• Repairs: vertical + horizontal + (one diagonal) mirroring (triadic sets appear generically necessary).
• Topology: toroidal wrap-closure is a first-class operator; there are no “budgeted exceptions” (we eliminated the so‑called “Joker”).
Acceptance rule: a candidate local move is admissible if it does not increase and passes the local pal constraints; replaying it is idempotent (same result on reapplication).
5. Closure Functional and CBC
• CBC (Count-Before-Close): enumerate all legal local gates before applying any global normalization (e.g., before picking a canonical palindrome/pose).
• Idempotent closure: Only after gate counting, we can canonicalize (pose-fix, pal rest) for storage/telemetry.
6. Policy Channels (A–D × 1–8)
Enumerating gates on the board yields exactly 8 legal insertion sites at from a pal rest:
• four orbits under lane-preserving D8 (two corner orbits, two center-block orbits), each split by phase → 8 channels.
• We label them A1, A2 (corner–main), B3, B4 (corner–anti), C5, C6 (center–main), D7, D8 (center–anti).
These channels are not just names—they govern moves in lift pipelines.
7. Alena Operators (discrete moves)
Let a state be with object , chamber context , parity/mirror signature , and midpoint stack .
• (rotate‑to‑nearest‑kissing): move within a Coxeter/Coxeter-plane step minimizing holding fixed.
• (parity-base duplication): clone a base face under , re-embed with mirror parity, enforce pal alignment.
• (midpoint expansion): split about pal midpoint; push walls; diagonal lanes reserved; update .
Invariant: Each operator is non‑increasing in . This gives a Lyapunov-like guarantee of progress.
8. MORSR (Middle‑Out Ripple Shape Reader)
A measurement protocol, not a heuristic:
• Pulse from the center, record lane-wise handshake (which shapes/constraints each node claims).
• Expand to cardinal directions, reserve diagonals.
• Fire outside‑in to meet the middle contracts.
• Saturation at eight lanes marks chamber completion.
Outputs are structured as a handshake contract (JSON), usable across domains.
9. Projection Overlays (E₈ / Leech)
Use overlays after gate counting to:
• color quadrants (hex codes/gradients),
• attach per-node metadata,
• trace policy-channel paths,
• snapshot Leech-like fingerprints for provenance.
Overlays are telemetry only.
Part II — Algorithms and Pipelines
A. Gate Enumeration on the 4×4 Torus ()
Inputs: pal seed on 4×4 torus, parity lanes; lane-preserving D8; wrap-closure; local pal constraints; = pal defects.
Procedure:
• For each cell among 16 candidates, propose inserting the new symbol (e.g., “5”).
• Apply mirrored repairs: vertical, horizontal, and one diagonal to keep row/col pal constraints.
• Accept if and idempotent.
• Partition accepted sites into equivalence under lane-preserving D8.
• Label each accepted cell with policy channel (A–D × Type 1–8).
Outcome: exactly 8 admissible gates: four orbits × two phases.
Telemetry: store mapping JSON (cells, parity, mirrors used, orbit label, channel tag), and an SVG map for human traceability.
B. Lift Pipeline ()
• Start at pal rest (or canonical chamber rest) with the board seed.
• CBC: enumerate legal gates and tag with policy channels.
• Choose a channel (or explore all) to insert the new symbol; apply Alena ops with local admissibility checks.
• Close idempotently for storage; project to overlays for telemetry.
• Persist overlays and the gate event (append to ledger); support replay/recovery.
C. MORSR Handshake Protocol (JSON schema sketch)
{ "handshake_id": "...", "seed_pose": "pal_v_first", "pulses": [ {"direction": "middle_out", "steps": ["center", "cardinals", "reserve_diagonals"]}, {"direction": "outside_in", "steps": ["gates", "converge_to_center"]} ], "lanes": 8, "contracts": [ {"cell": [i,j], "accepted": true, "mirrors": ["vert","horiz","diag"], "phi_before": 0, "phi_after": 0, "policy": "C6", "orbit": "center_main"} ], "saturation": true, "overlay_refs": {"e8_quadrant": "#3498DB", "leech_slice": "L24-..."} } 
D. Overlay Library (registry)
• Shapes: pal seeds, gate maps, E₈ coloring, Leech-lite fingerprints.
• IDs are stable, overlays immutable; new contexts reference overlays, they never rewrite them.
E. Harness Controls (ablation-ready)
• CBC toggle: count-first vs close-first.
• Symmetry scope: lane-preserving D8 vs full dihedral vs smaller groups.
• Repair cardinality: 1, 2, 3 (triadic) mirrored repairs.
• Topology: on/off.
• Overlay timing: post-count vs pre-count projection.
Part III — Worked Examples
Example 1 — on the Board (core demonstration)
Pal seed (one convenient pose):
1 2 2 1 3 4 4 3 3 4 4 3 1 2 2 1 
Admissibility: insert “5”; allow repairs (vert+horiz+diag or vert+horiz+anti‑diag); must keep and be idempotent.
Result: accept exactly the 8 cells: four corners and the 2×2 center block. Under lane-preserving D8, two orbits of corners (main vs anti) and two orbits of centers (main vs anti) → 4 orbits × 2 phases = 8 policy channels.
Why triadic repairs? Single/double mirrors typically break a row/col pal; the triad preserves both row and column palindromy simultaneously—a minimal, local, symmetry‑coherent fix.
Example 2 — Partial lift (sketch)
• Start from board after an accepted gate (say C6 center–main phase).
• Enumerate new gates for “6” under the same rules; record the trace and channel transitions (e.g., C6→B3, etc.).
• Verify that CBC still preserves a separable eight‑channel structure on constrained subsets (expect some merging only if symmetries are expanded or repairs underpowered).
Example 3 — Audio/Voice Analogy
• Objects: syllable nuclei tokens with cyclic bands for energy/pitch (wrap topology); local admissibility = band-fit + triadic adjustment (time, pitch, energy).
• CBC: enumerate legal placements of a new prosodic event before normalizing timing.
• Policy channels: map to eight prosodic feature lanes; projections (MFCC/E₈ coloring) only after gate counting.
• MORSR: middle-out pulse (syllabic center) followed by outside-in (boundary pauses); saturation when eight constraints agree.
Example 4 — E₈/Leech overlay sanity
• After counting gates, color gate cells by E₈ quadrant; attach Leech-lite fingerprints to each policy channel for provenance comparison across runs.
• This improves traceability without deciding legality.
Part IV — What CQE Can Be
• A general compiler for symmetry‑respecting combinatorial pipelines
• Input: configuration , minimal symmetry , local rules, .
• Output: an execution plan (gate enumeration → policy channel graph → lift map) plus telemetry overlays.
• A measurement layer for ML systems
• Wrap model decisions inside CBC + MORSR to measure hidden multiplicity in attention/gating; attach overlays for human audit.
• A robust controller for cyclic scheduling, coding, and codec design
• Apply , triadic repairs, and policy channels to packet schedulers, error-correcting layouts, or multi-band codecs.
• A symmetry‑aware search engine
• Use policy channels as constrained exploration modes; avoid premature canonicalization that collapses valid branches.
• A reproducibility harness
• Overlay registries (immutable IDs) + policy channel logs → replays become deterministic and auditable.
Part V — Evidence‑Backed Guesses (yet to be proven here)
• Octadic universality at first nontrivial lift
• Hypothesis: in cyclic constrained systems with a pal rest, eight channels arise generically when locality/topology are respected.
• Why we think so: we saw 4 orbits → 8 phases without forcing E₈; similar 4→8 fan‑outs appear in audio/prosody sketches.
• Triadic repair necessity
• Hypothesis: fewer than three symmetric local repairs either (i) collapse multiplicity (mirror bias) or (ii) break monotonicity.
• Overlay‑timing law
• Hypothesis: projecting before gate counting consistently undercounts classes; projecting after preserves them.
• MORSR as a universal stop rule
• Hypothesis: middle‑out + outside‑in pulses agreeing within two cycles indicates chamber completion across domains.
Part VI — Falsifiers & Ablation Plan
• F1 (CBC): allow closure before counting → expect 8→7 (corner/center phase fusion). If 8 persists, our CBC claim is overstated.
• F2 (Symmetry): expand to full dihedral + relabel → expect 8→7 or fewer. If 8 survives, lane‑preserving may be overly strict.
• F3 (Topology): remove → expect near‑zero admissible gates or brittle cases. If many still pass, wrap isn’t critical.
• F4 (Repairs): restrict to ≤2 mirrored repairs → expect failure to preserve pal constraints. If triadic isn’t needed, refine local rule.
• F5 (Overlay timing): project before counting; if 8 persists, projection timing is benign.
Each falsifier is a single‑knob change with a measurable expected outcome.
Part VII — Axioms / Rules of Use
• Topology First: specify boundary conditions explicitly (e.g., toroidal ).
• CBC: enumerate local legal gates before any global canonicalization.
• Minimal Symmetry: use the smallest faithful group (lane‑preserving D8 on the board).
• Local‑First: local admissibility + triadic mirrors; global is validation, not selection.
• Idempotence: accepted moves replay to the same state.
• Policy over Labels: channels govern legal moves and must compose.
• Projection After: overlays (E₈/Leech) are telemetry applied post‑count.
• Persist Overlays: immutable registry; never recompute shapes that can be referenced.
• Traceability: every gate event logs pose, repairs, , channel, overlay refs.
