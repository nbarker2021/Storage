The Physics of Sound: From Atomic Vibrations to Harmonics
Sound is fundamentally a mechanical wave – a disturbance that propagates through a medium (such as air, water, or solids) by making the particles of that medium oscillate. It cannot travel through a vacuum because there are no particles to carry the vibrations. On the atomic scale, sound is essentially an organized vibration of atoms or molecules: a sound wave moves atoms in a coordinated way that is much more ordered than their random thermal motion. In many cases (like a steady tone), this disturbance is periodic, meaning the particles oscillate in a regular pattern (simple harmonic motion). Thanks to this orderly motion, sound waves can induce resonances – for example, a strong sound at just the right frequency can shake objects and even shatter a wine glass by matching its natural vibration frequency.
Sound as a Mechanical Wave in a Medium
When a source (like a speaker or a plucked guitar string) produces sound, it causes the surrounding particles to vibrate back and forth. For instance, a vibrating speaker cone pushes and pulls on the air next to it, creating regions of compression (where air molecules are squeezed together, raising the pressure) and rarefaction (where molecules are spread apart, lowering the pressure). These compressions and rarefactions travel outward through the air as a longitudinal wave – the oscillations of the air molecules are parallel to the direction the wave moves. In fluids (gases and liquids), sound waves are longitudinal because fluids don’t resist shear (sideways) deformation. In solids, by contrast, sound can propagate not only as longitudinal waves but also as transverse waves (where particles vibrate perpendicular to the wave’s direction) because solids have elasticity against shear. In all cases, the sound wave carries energy outward from the source without permanently displacing matter (each particle ends up oscillating around an equilibrium position). This process is governed by Newton’s laws of motion – in fact, advanced physics texts derive the sound wave equations directly from basic mechanics, treating sound as a branch of classical mechanics. Sound waves obey the standard wave equation (a second-order differential equation), just like other wave phenomena, meaning disturbances propagate in a way that depends on the medium’s properties.
Illustration of a sound wave produced by a speaker: (a) The speaker’s vibration creates high-pressure compressions (where air molecules are crowded, labeled “HP”) and low-pressure rarefactions (“LP”) that propagate outward as a longitudinal pressure wave (red sine curve shows pressure variation). (b) Equivalently, we can describe the wave by the displacement of air molecules (blue cosine curve). Air molecules oscillate back-and-forth about their equilibrium positions, in step with the passing wave. Note that the particle motion is parallel to the direction of wave travel, which is characteristic of longitudinal sound waves.
Because sound is a mechanical vibration, its speed and behavior depend on the medium’s physical properties. Generally, sound travels faster in media that are stiffer (harder to compress) and slower in media that are more dense (heavier to move). Quantitatively, the speed of sound $v$ is given by a ratio of the medium’s elastic property to its inertia. For example, in a fluid the wave speed is $v = \sqrt{B/\rho}$, where $B$ is the bulk modulus (stiffness to compression) and $\rho$ is the density. In a solid, a similar formula $v = \sqrt{Y/\rho}$ holds, with $Y$ the Young’s modulus (stiffness). Temperature also affects sound speed in gases – warmer air is faster because molecules move more quickly. In dry air at 0 °C, sound travels about 331 m/s, increasing to roughly 343 m/s at 20 °C.
Sound Propagation in Different Media (with Data)
Sound can propagate through gases, liquids, and solids, but its speed and efficiency vary widely. Below is a list of representative mediums with well-known sound speeds, based on experimental data:
• Air (gas, 0 °C): ~331 m/s (increases to ~343 m/s at 20 °C). Air is easily compressible, which makes the sound speed relatively low. (For comparison, the random thermal speed of air molecules is much higher; sound is the organized motion riding on top of random motion.)
• Helium (gas, 0 °C): ~965 m/s. Helium’s sound speed is about 3× faster than air because helium is much less dense and has a higher adiabatic index (hence the “chipmunk” voice effect – helium doesn’t make voice pitch higher, but the higher sound speed shifts resonant frequencies of the vocal tract).
• Water (liquid, 20 °C): ~1480 m/s. Water is far less compressible than air, so sound moves about 4.3× faster than in air. This is why marine animals rely on sound for long-distance communication underwater.
• Steel (solid): ~5960 m/s. In a rigid solid like steel, atoms are tightly bonded, making it very stiff. Sound travels extremely fast in such media (about 17× faster than in air). Other solids have similarly high speeds (e.g. glass ~5640 m/s, aluminum ~5120 m/s), whereas a very soft solid (rubber) has a much lower speed (~54 m/s) due to its low stiffness.
These data illustrate that sound’s propagation speed is not a universal constant like light’s speed, but rather depends on material properties. A useful rule of thumb is that sound moves fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases, because solids are hardest to compress and gases are easiest. If there is no medium (perfect vacuum), sound cannot propagate at all, since there are no particles to transmit the vibrations.
Aside from speed, the medium also affects how sound attenuates (fades) over distance. As a sound wave spreads out from its source, its energy is distributed over a larger and larger sphere (in open air), so the intensity (power per area) drops off with distance. In an ideal free field, intensity decreases roughly with the square of the distance (the inverse-square law). Moreover, some of the wave’s energy is gradually absorbed by the medium: the vibrations get converted into tiny amounts of heat due to the medium’s viscosity and thermal conductivity. In air, for example, the amplitude of a sound wave will gradually diminish as the wave travels, because some energy is lost as heat with each compression-rarefaction cycle. This absorption is why distant sounds eventually become inaudible and why higher-frequency sounds (which get absorbed more readily) don’t carry as far as low frequencies. In summary, sound spreads out and attenuates due to geometric spreading and absorption, although in a reflective environment (like an indoor space) echoes and reverberation can carry sound further by continual reflections.
Interference: How Sound Waves Combine
When multiple sound waves meet in the same space, they superpose – meaning the air’s displacement or pressure at any point is the sum of the disturbances from all waves. This is known as the principle of superposition. Importantly, unlike solid objects, waves can pass through each other; as they overlap, their effects add together. The result of this addition is called interference. If the peaks of two waves line up (in phase), they constructively interfere and produce a combined wave with larger amplitude (louder sound). If a peak of one wave aligns with a trough of another (out of phase), they destructively interfere, partially or even completely cancelling each other out. In practice, most locations will experience a mix of constructive and destructive interference from multiple sound waves, leading to complex spatial patterns of louder and softer sound.
One everyday application of destructive interference is noise-canceling headphones. These devices actively generate a sound wave that is the mirror-opposite of the unwanted noise. When the artificial “anti-noise” wave meets the incoming noise, the two cancel each other (ideally) through destructive interference, resulting in a dramatically reduced net sound. Another common interference effect is the phenomenon of beats. Beats occur when two sounds of slightly different frequency play together. The waves alternately reinforce and cancel each other, causing the combined sound to pulsate in loudness. For example, if you strike two piano keys that are a bit out of tune, the superposition alternates between constructive and destructive interference, making the volume wobble up and down – a beat frequency equal to the difference between the two pitches. Musicians actually use this beat effect to tune instruments: when the beats slow and disappear, the two notes are at the same frequency.
It’s worth noting that despite interference, after waves pass through each other, they continue on as if they never met (assuming the medium is linear and no energy was lost). This linear superposition principle holds true as long as the sound amplitudes are not too extreme. At very high intensities, sound waves can cause nonlinear effects in the medium (distorting the wave shape or producing new frequencies), but everyday sounds and normal conditions are well described by linear wave theory.
Harmonics: The Building Blocks of Musical Sound
Most sounds we hear are not pure single-frequency tones but a blend of frequencies. Any periodic sound (one that repeats in time, like a musical note) has a lowest fundamental frequency and a series of higher frequencies that are integer multiples of that fundamental. These higher integer-multiple frequencies are called harmonics (or overtones or partials). In physics terms, a harmonic is a sinusoidal component of the sound whose frequency = n × (fundamental frequency), where n is an integer (1, 2, 3, …). The fundamental itself is considered the 1st harmonic, the 2nd harmonic is twice the fundamental frequency, the 3rd harmonic is three times, and so on. All the harmonics together form a harmonic series, and their sum reproduces the overall waveform of the sound. This principle is a cornerstone of Fourier analysis: any complex periodic waveform can be mathematically broken down into a sum of simple harmonics. The presence and relative strength of various harmonics are what give different instruments or voices their unique timbre (tone color), even if they play the same fundamental note. For example, a middle C on a piano and the same note on a violin have the same fundamental frequency (~261.6 Hz), but each produces a distinctive mix of harmonics that our ears use to tell them apart.
How are harmonics produced? Resonance in musical instruments naturally leads to harmonics. A vibrating string fixed at both ends supports standing wave modes that correspond to its fundamental and higher harmonics (half-wavelength, third-wavelength segments, etc.). Similarly, air columns in wind instruments have resonant modes for harmonics. Because these systems are linear, any energy put into the fundamental mode can also excite the higher modes (and vice versa) in small amounts. Thus, normal playing produces a blend of frequencies. Harmonics are a linear phenomenon – they’re expected whenever you have a periodic oscillation. As one source puts it, harmonics will “occur in any linear system” that is driven periodically.
Now, what about frequencies below the fundamental? These are called subharmonics (or undertones), meaning fractional multiples of the fundamental (like 1/2, 1/3 of the main frequency). Under normal linear conditions, subharmonics do not appear in the spectrum of a sound. Typical instruments or speakers do not spontaneously generate frequencies lower than the fundamental they are driven at. It requires special circumstances or nonlinear behavior to get subharmonics. In other words, subharmonic frequencies are an exotic occurrence: they are “integral submultiples of the fundamental (driving) frequency” that generally arise only through nonlinear effects. For example, certain nonlinear acoustic systems (like a fluid-filled resonator driven very strongly, or a phenomenon in a bowed instrument with extra pressure) can produce a tone at half the driving frequency – essentially a period-doubled vibration. The human voice can also be trained to produce undertone singing (subharmonic singing), where the vocal folds oscillate in a special pattern to create a pitch below the normal range. However, even in these cases, the partials of the sound still align with a harmonic series of some lower fundamental; the system has effectively latched onto a lower-frequency mode of oscillation. The key point is that linear acoustics (the standard way sound waves add and propagate) does not support subharmonics. Only under “fairly restricted conditions” – essentially involving nonlinear vibrations – will you get the phenomenon known as subharmonic generation. In summary, harmonics (overtones above a fundamental) are ubiquitous in sound and well-explained by linear wave theory, whereas subharmonics (undertones below a given fundamental) are rare and indicate some form of nonlinear behavior or an external modulation creating those lower frequencies.
Advanced Perspectives and Further Reading
The description above uses common language to explain how sound works, but underneath is rigorous math and physics. For those interested in a deeper, graduate-level understanding, we can point to a few references and concepts:
• Derivation of Sound Equations: Sound propagation can be derived from first principles (Newton’s laws and fluid dynamics). For instance, The Feynman Lectures on Physics derive the one-dimensional acoustic wave equation by considering how air pressure and density fluctuations obey Newton’s second law and continuity of flow. This derivation shows that sound waves satisfy the classical wave equation ($\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial t^2}$) and relates the wave speed $v$ to medium properties (as given earlier). Such advanced texts highlight that “sound is a branch of mechanics” and its behavior *“is to be understood in terms of Newton’s laws”*. In essence, all the macroscopic phenomena of acoustics (reflection, refraction, resonance, Doppler effect, etc.) can be derived from fundamental physics. For a thorough mathematical treatment, one might consult graduate acoustics textbooks or fluid mechanics references that cover the acoustic wave equation and its solutions.
• Sound at the Atomic and Quantum Level: In solids, the vibrations that constitute sound waves can be described in terms of quantized normal modes known as phonons. A phonon is essentially a quantum of vibrational energy – one way to think of it is as a “particle” of sound (analogous to the photon being a particle of light). In condensed matter physics, phonons are crucial for understanding thermal and electrical properties. As an example, long-wavelength acoustic phonons correspond to ordinary sound waves traveling through a crystal. This is an advanced concept that merges quantum mechanics with acoustics: the idea that the collective atomic vibrations in a solid are quantized. While this doesn’t change the everyday wave behavior of sound, it’s important at very small scales and low temperatures.
• Nonlinear Acoustics: At very high sound intensities or in special media, the linear assumptions break down. Researchers study how intense sound can generate shock waves, combine to form new frequencies, or exhibit chaotic behavior. For example, experiments with acoustic waves in liquids containing bubbles have shown generation of subharmonic frequencies and even ultra-harmonics (fractional multiples) once a certain amplitude threshold is passed. These nonlinear acoustics topics are on the frontier of current research and require advanced mathematics (often partial differential equations with nonlinear terms) to analyze. They are relevant in fields like ultrasound technology, SONAR in complex media, and even medical applications (e.g. high-intensity focused ultrasound).
In conclusion, sound “works” through well-understood physics: it is the propagation of mechanical vibrations through a medium via particle interactions. We can quantify it with equations and predict its behavior across different materials and conditions. The concepts of harmonics explain why complex sounds have rich tonal structure, and the absence (or engineered creation) of subharmonics reminds us that linear wave theory has limits, beyond which new and interesting effects occur. By studying sound from the atomic level up to large-scale wave phenomena, scientists have gathered detailed experimental data and developed theories that match those findings. This deep understanding is what allows us to design everything from musical instruments and concert halls to ultrasound imagers and noise-canceling devices – all harnessing the fundamental principles of how sound spreads and interacts in our world.
