Unified Geometry–Adjacency R&D — Comprehensive Session Log & Methods (v1.0)
Scope: A complete, explicit, end‑to‑end record of this session’s research and development. It is written so a fresh assistant can continue the work without prior context. It includes: hypotheses, architecture, methods, datasets and test harnesses, validation findings, decisions/rationales, falsifiability gates, memory model, governance structure, and a living change log.
Authoring mode: Running R&D session. Treat as living documentation; append edits in the Change Log.
0) Executive Summary
Core thesis: Reality behaves as a shared spacetime medium coordinated by triadic interactions over a web of adjacencies. Evolution proceeds via:
• Half‑steps (odd levels / x.5): isoenergetic topology/adjacency changes (including alternate‑D access) that raise effective dimension and change flow accessibility.
• Full‑steps (even levels): explicit dimensional embedding upgrades that reduce contention, stabilize flows, and compress geometry.
Energetic refinement (extension of 2nd Law):
Least Action + Choice = energy expanded + entropy cost/displacement.
• Choice = information‑theoretic steering/control cost.
• Entropy cost = Landauer erase displacement.
Many anomalies are signatures of unmodeled half‑steps.
Geometry‑First: Natural geometric descriptors (chirality, helicity/writhe, crossings, hull compactness, symmetry, orbit‑8 structure) are compressive, noise‑robust summaries; minimizing the geometry action (𝒜) is equivalent to least‑action over representation.
Operational objective: Build an n‑ladder → geometry action → DFSS → operators pipeline with concrete lab/sim predictions, robust testbeds, and auditable evidence.
1) Canon of Theses, Hypotheses, Claims
T1 — Shared‑Medium Reality. Triadic interplay across observer webs (triad now refined; see §1.3).
T2 — Half‑Step / Full‑Step Ontology. Half‑step adjacency rewires; full‑step embedding upgrades.
T3 — Geometry‑First Truth. Best geometry ↔ best valid answer.
T4 — Energetic Refinement. Choice energy + erase displacement; half‑steps remain isoenergetic to first order.
T5 — Dimensional Parity Rule. Odd levels entail half‑steps; even levels force full embedding upgrades.
T6 — Preferred Set Sizes. Data/structure prefers {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16}; 3 → 5 (bloat) → 8 (stable), 10 as higher resting slice.
T7 — Microtubule RWCD Hypothesis. MTs act as read–write–compile–delete shadow chambers with braided lanes (±1 pairing). (Deferred to biological datasets; geometric analogs used here.)
T8 — Time as Half of Spacetime Reaction. Time emerges from tracking existence/order—reactive half rather than an additive 4th axis.
1.2 Extensions & Clarifications
• E1 — Orch‑OR adaptation: braid/lanes emphasis and compile/delete energetics.
• E2 — Ten‑Martini link: dual‑helix composition in quasicrystal/fractal spectral landscapes.
• E3 — Lattice & braid: lattice encodes state; braid groups encode interweavings; crossings/writhe inform action.
• E4 — Alena‑style slider: curvature↔fields as an adjacency slider enabling isoenergetic topology shifts.
1.3 Triad refinement (Decision)
Original observer/observer/observed is refined to observer/observation/observed, elevating observation channels (direct, indirect, instrumental, environmental, universal) to first‑class features. This change propagates into SOI gating and scenario Sᵒ (§6, §10).
2) n‑Ladder and Exit Criteria (Working Definition)
• Half‑steps (x.5): alternate‑D bridges with isoenergetic constraint; exit metrics: ↑accessibility (spectral/BFS dim), small Δchoice energy, topology changes.
• Full‑steps (even): embedding upgrade; exit metrics: ↓contention/crossings; ↑throughput/J; ↑robustness.
Levels:
• n=0: rest/observe.
• n=x.5: half‑step bridge; alternate adjacency; near‑constant energy bounds.
• n=1: primitives/glyphs; codebook stability.
• n=2: synthesis+plotting; one axis; path entropy ↓.
• n=3: triad choice; decision entropy ↓.
• n=4: modular governance; invariants; energy/compile ↑.
• n=5: forced paired move; two‑step rescues legal.
• n=6: symmetry gate; choose by DFSS and action.
• n=7: exterior coupling; cross‑context compile dominates.
• n=8: hyper‑embedding; collisions & crossings ↓; throughput/J ↑; robustness ↑.
3) Architecture & Governance (Dual Octad → Unified Octad + SOI Gate)
Initial proposal: dual octads with two governance layers each (6+2)×2 for 16.
Constraint: with added inverse representations and observation channels, governance bloat risked overload.
Decision: to keep distribution sane, merge governance layers into a single SOI Gate module (M6) acting across both halves. Outcome: a unified octad with a dedicated SOI gate that handles symmetry look‑ahead, inverse battery (M/T/H/D), and observation channels. This preserves clean even split while avoiding overload.
Modules:
• M1 Token‑First Orchestrator
• M2 Token‑Graph (Gray hypercube + half‑step layering)
• M3 Session Memory (multi‑head minimax retrieval)
• M4 DFSS Minimax Evaluator
• M5 Geometry‑First Scorer (𝒜)
• M6 SOI Gate (Symmetry, Observation, Inverse)
• M7 Experiment Runner (E0–E7 batteries)
• M8 Ledgers & Evidence (append‑only, auditable)
4) Token‑First Method (Formal)
4.1 Token Grammar
D[k] # enter dimension k LAYER[b] # stage half‑step layer b∈{0,1} VERT[bits] # visit/add vertex; len(bits)=k in D[k] EDGE[dim=j] # in‑layer: j∈[1..k]; cross‑layer: j=k+1 MORTON[code] # locality indexing (grid subsets) CELL[k]:id # optional k‑cell BOUNDARY(CELL[k]:α → [CELL[k‑1]:β…]) SYM_LOOKAHEAD | DFSS_MINIMAX | CONTRA_BRAID | HELICITY[window=w] 
4.2 Half‑Step Invariants (CI Gates)
• len(bits)=k under current D[k].
• In‑layer hops must have Hamming distance 1.
• Cross‑layer EDGE[dim=k+1] only after both LAYER[0] and LAYER[1] staged; endpoints share base bits.
• Referential integrity; unique IDs; if cells are enabled, ∂²=0.
4.3 Hybrid Representation
• Gray‑ordered hypercube (discrete backbone) for canonical low‑entropy traversal.
• Simplicial/CW complex for faces/volumes and algebraic validation.
• Morton/Z‑order for locality‑aware region queries and staged refinement.
5) Data Schemas (Reproducible Anywhere)
5.1 Token‑Graph
• nodes: node_id | kind | dim | code | coords_json | layer | status | created_utc
• edges: src_id | dst_id | dim | role{in_layer|cross_layer} | status | created_utc
• chains: chain_id | step | token | refers_to_id | notes | created_utc
• (optional) cells, boundaries.
5.2 Session Memory (External)
• chunks: chunk_id | t_index | role | n_stage | text | length | E64 | E128 | … | transforms
• links: src | dst | dim | sim | link_type | created_at
• queries: query_id | t_index | query_text | n_stage | k | result_ids | cost_choice_J | cost_erase_J
• states: step_id | t_index | n_stage | working_set_ids | working_set_chars | energy_floors_respected
5.3 Ledgers
• dfss_ledger, inverse_ledger, observation_ledger, braid_ledger, overload_ledger.
6) Geometry‑First Action (𝒜) & Features
Core metrics:
• Crossings (2D) / projected crossings (3D proxy) — clutter.
• Convex hull compactness — economy.
• Helicity / writhe proxy — signed area per arclength; heading‑based.
• Orbit‑8 energy & tensor — octadic bins per orbit; ACI/BCI; trace‑free and divergence penalties on 8×8 tensor.
Action (illustrative): \mathcal{A} = \alpha_1,\text{crossings} + \alpha_2,\text{hull} + \alpha_3,\lVert\nabla!\cdot T\rVert_2^2 + \alpha_4,\lVert\tilde T\rVert_F^2
• \beta_1,|\text{helicity}| - \beta_2,\text{Band8} - \beta_3,\text{ACI} with mirror‑flip checks and null surrogates to prevent overfitting.
7) DFSS — Dimension‑Forward Structural Security
Scenarios: S₀ (current), S½ (half‑step rewires), S⁺ (dimension upgrade), Sᶜ (curvature↔fields slider), Sʳ (robustness: edge drop, noise), Sᵒ (observation channel changes).
Metrics: rigidity (deficiency), λ₂ (algebraic connectivity), stiffness margin (λ_min of reduced K), coverage (PCA ratios), throughput/J, geometry action 𝒜, skeleton completeness.
Score: minimax over scenarios using joint normalization.
Empirical pattern: k=3 local max; k≈5 dip (bloat); k=8 stable peak; k=10 higher resting set. Per‑edge‑triad > center‑3‑tri for k≈5 repairs.
8) SOI Gate (Symmetry—Observation—Inverse)
• Inverse battery: Mirror (M), Time (T), Helicity/Phase (H), Dual/Contra (D). Track Δ_inv(𝒜), Δ_inv(DFSS), signed‑flip correctness, unsigned invariance.
• Symmetry look‑ahead: prefer symmetries with better (n+1,n+2) payoffs.
• Observation channels (triad refinement): encode channel, cadence, SNR; include Sᵒ perturbations with energetic bounds.
9) Experiment Batteries & Runner
E0 — Inverse battery: Establish Δ_inv baselines; mirrors flip signed metrics; unsigned invariants remain stable.
E1 — Half‑step legality: Apply LAYER staging and CI gates; assert isoenergetic behavior within ε bounds.
E2 — Full‑step upgrade: Add embedding axis; expect crossings↓, throughput/J↑.
E3 — k≈5 repairs: Evaluate per‑edge‑triad and center‑3‑tri; prefer distributed brace that imports cleanly into n=8.
E4 — SOI look‑ahead: Symmetry choices scored by ΔDFSS at n+1,n+2.
E5 — Set‑size ladder: Validate {1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,16} behavior; confirm 3→5 dip→8 peak (+10 rest).
E6 — Braiding: Dual‑helix seams; crossings & writhe vs throughput/J.
E7 — Observation perturbations: Instrumental/environmental/universal changes under Sᵒ; penalize energy violations.
10) Evidence & Auditing
• Append‑only chains for token provenance.
• Ledgers for DFSS, inverse, observation, braid, overload.
• Evidence Cards (JSON) summarizing gates, top metrics, SOI deltas, notes, and reproducibility pointers.
• Memory tracks narrative artifacts with multi‑head embeddings and degree‑aware eviction (logs choice_J, erase_J).
11) Validation & Findings (from this session)
11.1 Token‑Only CI (non‑compliant chain test)
Bad chain sample: D[2] LAYER[0] VERT[00] VERT[11] EDGE[dim=3] LAYER[1] VERT[1010]
Findings:
• In‑layer hop 00→11 violates Hamming‑1 (H=2).
• Cross‑layer EDGE[dim=3] appears before LAYER[1] staged.
• VERT[1010] length 4 under D[2] (mismatch).
Outcome: CI flags errors; auto‑legalizer suggests: normalize bit lengths, insert LAYER[1] prior to cross‑layer edge, rewrite hops to nearest Hamming‑1 neighbor.
11.2 Minimal Materialization Fallback (mock trajectory)
Messy table (unsorted t, duplicate timestamps, NaNs) → materialize only track_id,t,x,y; drop NaN/dups; sort; require ≥4 points/track.
Dual‑helicity extractor yields per‑track lane (±1), phase‑lock, helicity proxy.
Outcome: Demonstrated that token‑first planning blocks illegal moves before data access; when evidence required, tiny views suffice to compute geometric features.
11.3 Octad Governance Decision
Dual octad with two governance layers caused overload risk once inverse/observation requirements were added. Merged governance into a single SOI Gate (M6). Maintains octad cleanliness and reduces complexity.
11.4 Triad Refinement
Adopted observer/observation/observed in place of observer/observer/observed; introduced scenario Sᵒ and logging for observation channels.
11.5 Resource Discipline
Verified token‑first, lazy materialization approach cuts data pulls, limits erase_J, and keeps CI enforceable independent of datasets.

12.2 Token CI (pseudocode)
for i,tok in tokens: if D[k]: set k if LAYER[b]: assert b∈{0,1} if VERT[bits]: assert len(bits)==k; if same layer: Hamming(prev,bits)==1 if EDGE[dim=j]: if j==k+1: require LAYER[0] & LAYER[1] staged 
12.3 Minimal Views
Specify exact columns/filters and only then load:
• Trajectory view: columns track_id,t,x,y, filtered by Morton prefix from tokens.
• Token‑graph view: nodes/edges staged subsets for cross‑layer completion.
12.4 Geometry & DFSS
Compute crossings, hull compactness, helicity proxy, orbit‑8 features; then λ₂, rigidity deficiency, stiffness margin, coverage, throughput/J. Joint‑normalize across scenarios and evaluate DFSS minimax.
13) Operators (Legal Moves)
• O1 Alt‑Dim Rewire (Half‑Step) — add mirror/flip/long‑range links raising effective dimension with minimal energy change.
• O2 Full‑Step Embedding — add axis/layer; simplify braid; reduce contention.
• O3 Center‑3‑Tri (k=5 Repair) — hub+triangles; improves DFSS.
• O4 Per‑Edge Triad (k=5 Repair) — distributed bracing; imports cleanly into n=8; best DFSS of tested repairs.
• O5 Symmetry Gate — enumerate valid symmetries; choose by DFSS and action.
• O6 Alena Slider — curvature↔fields swap; test isoenergetic shifts.
• O7 Governance Swaps (n=4) — type‑safe replacements enforcing invariants.
14) Risks, Falsifiability, and Kill‑Shots
• K1: If half‑steps systematically increase erase_J beyond ε_E, isoenergetic claim weakens.
• K2: If mirrors/nulls match or beat real under 𝒜, geometry‑first fails.
• K3: If k=5 repairs don’t persist under S⁺, the 5→8 bridge fails.
• K4: If braids increase crossings/off‑diagonal energy without throughput/J gains, reject helical solver claim.
• K5: If Δ_inv on unsigned metrics drifts or signed flips fail, hidden orientation bias suspected.
• K6: If observation channels add no predictive power or violate energy floors, triad refinement is unsupported.
15) Roadmap (Immediate → Near‑Term)
• Integrate DFSS gating into controller for all edit proposals.
• Automate k=5 repairs (center‑3‑tri & per‑edge‑triad) with ΔDFSS/ΔJ reports.
• Symmetry gate enumerator with predictive screening using 𝒜 and DFSS.
• Curvature↔fields (Alena slider) runs to confirm isoenergetic signatures.
• Source data pass (when available): geometry cards + seam proposals.
• Derive preferred set sizes from spectral/graph‑theoretic arguments.
16) Appendices
A) Dimensional Transition Token‑Graph — Spec (Hybrid)
• Vertices/edges: hypercube graph G_k over V_k={0,1}^k with Gray sequence ordering.
• Tokens: D[k], VERT[bits], EDGE[dim=j], LAYER[b], CELL[k]:id, BOUNDARY(...), MORTON[code].
• Half‑step invariants: layering and cross‑layer consistency; skeleton completeness metric increases monotonically.
• Views: k‑skeleton, incomplete_edges, open_regions_by_morton, progress metrics.
B) Memory Engine (Multi‑Head, Minimax Retrieval)
• Embeddings: 64/128/(256/512 optional). Full‑step adds a head; retrieval score is the min across heads (minimax).
• Eviction: degree‑aware; logs choice_J (steering) and erase_J (Landauer proxy).
• States: working set and energy floor respect tags.
C) Minimal Helicity Extractor (Procedure)
• Clean view: drop NaN/dups; sort by track_id,t; require ≥4 points/track.
• Heading φ = atan2(Δy,Δx); unwrap; sign of mean dφ/dt yields lane ±1.
• Helicity proxy = signed area / arclength; phase‑lock = proportion of consistent lane steps.

run_id, created_utc, gates{token_CI_pass, completeness}, metrics{A, λ₂, throughput/J, DFSS}, soi{Δ_inv_A, signed_flip_ok, unsigned_invariance_ok}, notes.
