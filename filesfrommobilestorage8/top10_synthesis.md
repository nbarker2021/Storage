**Top terms:** system, snaplat, lattice, user, all, glyph, complexity, data
**Key sentences (evidence-picked):**
- This approach prioritizes state-based optimization over re-computation, ensuring efficiency and traceability.
- This creates a nested network of traces that allows the system to explore the "glyph space" first and then deepen any part as needed by directed, slice-based calls for details and expansion of a glyph into its contained meaning [User Clarification].**

**Key Features and Advantages:**

*   **Uniform Structure and Symmetry:** The E8 lattice provides a consistent neighborhood of 240 nearest neighbors for every point, ensuring predictable traversal and search without irregularities.
- *   **Nearest Lattice Point:** Quantizes an embedding to the closest E8 node.
- **This stage, combined with the E8 lattice, allows SnapLat to explore the "glyph space" first, and then deepen any part as needed by directed, slice-based calls for details and expansion of a glyph into its contained meaning [User Clarification].**
*   **n = 6 (Glyph Consolidation – "Glyph Gate"):** The system prepares to finalize the glyph, potentially lifting its representation from plain words to a more symbolic form (e.g., using a known symbol like ∞).
- The fused result typically includes a consensus level, a disagreement metric, a measure of novelty, and potentially a recommended adjustment for the Planner (e.g., "increase search breadth slightly") [1].
- **Why Multiple Detectors?**

This multi-detector approach is a form of ensemble reasoning that prevents the system from being overly reliant on a single perspective.
**Port suggestions:** Runner/MORSR slice: adopt rail/rung pattern or acceptance criteria. | Governance slice: extract witness/quorum/seal rules; add to registry. | Slices/Memory slice: adopt/align layout and occupancy targets (#k). | Embedding/Seed: harvest feature extraction to improve S0. | Residue/CRT tools: port helpers to Tools slice.
