# The Morphonic Equilibrium — White Paper (v2)

**What’s new (review‑driven):**
- Clear pass/fail rule (closure certificate) in plain language.
- “Not‑Reality” now means “pending repair” with a specific fix path.
- A simple signal (“magic”) warns us when correlations surge and we should widen protection before committing.

## The idea in one sentence
Every trustworthy action is the meeting point of two stories: the one we try to make happen (forward beam) and the one that checks it (reverse beam). When they agree within a tiny tolerance **and** the energy/information budget is respected, we call it **Reality**.

## How we test ourselves
- We keep a tiny, unchanging “signature” of identity. If the action would change it, we stop.  
- We watch a resource signal called **magic**. When it spikes, we beef up protection (error‑correction) automatically.  
- We record everything as a receipt you can audit.

## Outcomes
- **Commit (Reality):** identity holds and the budget is fine.  
- **Pending repair (Not‑Reality):** we run a built‑in fix routine; if it works, we commit; if not, we refuse and say why.  
- **Refuse:** we won’t fake it; we’ll show the exact receipt of what failed.

## Why this matters
It makes computations, decisions, and policies **auditable**. The same pattern fits chips, labs, teams, and laws because they all need one thing: a forward plan and a reliable mirror that agree before you act.

**Artifacts referenced:** the v2 harness with the new checks, the MagicProbe results, and the meta‑ledger that logs critiques as mirrors in our process.
