1	Fractal Expansion and Binary Mathematical
2	Foundations
3	The CQE system builds on well-known mathematics – group theory, lattice geometry, linear algebra,
4	trigonometric and logarithmic maps – but all operations remain discrete and binary. For example, the
5	orbifold Euler formula for dihedral symmetry, $\chi(D_n)=2/n$, implies cell spacings like $a_\mathrm{eff}
6	=a_0/2^n$, a power‐of‐2 scaling 1 . This naturally ties into binary structures: the 24D lattice uses $
7	\mathbb{Z}_2^{24}$ (Golay code) coordinates 2 , parity checks, and digital-root tests to enforce decisions.
8	Even continuous functions like $\exp$, $\log$, $\sin$, $\cos$ are used in standard linear-algebraic ways
9	(e.g. $e^A$ for group transformations 3 ), and their outputs are thresholded or quantized into 0/1
10	“proceed-or-halt” decisions (ΔΦ≤0 criteria). In short, the math is classical (e.g. matrix exponentials,
11	Lissajous curves) but every state and transform is ultimately binary or parity-coded
12

15	.
16	
17	• Power‐of‐2 discretization: Dihedral group $D_{2^k}$ domains yield $a_\text{eff}=a_0/2^n$ tiling
18	1 .
19	• Binary codes: The underlying grid is $\mathbb{Z}_2^{24}$ (binary Golay), with D4/D8 actions on
20	coordinates 2 .
21	• Known transforms: Classic functions (sin/cos, log, exp) are applied with dihedral symmetrization to
22	enforce invariants. For instance, one study used a sin/log map on the complex plane: iterating $z
23	\mapsto \sin(z)+\log(z)$ (averaged over rotations) produced fractals whose structure directly gave
24	the same symmetry invariants (PNPA/Kakeya) that CQE computes numerically 4 5 .
25	• Lattice coverings: Transitions between Niemeier lattices use standard covering maps in Cayley
26	graphs (each move is a coset quotient) to maintain group consistency 6 . In practice this means the
27	system “retunes” its 24D lattice coordinates when moving from one geometry to another, but the
28	transforms are all from known algebraic forms and preserve parity (e.g. an $E_8$ reflection or Weyl
29	permutation) 7 .
30	
31	Cellular Automata and Tiling Patterns
32	CQE’s dynamics are expressed via cellular automata on high-dimensional lattices, revealing fractal
33	behavior. In particular, Rule 110 – a famously universal 1D CA – maps naturally onto lattice cells: each cell’s
34	0/1 output corresponds to the geometric “pass/fail” decision (ΔΦ≤0) of CQE. More broadly, Niemeier
35	lattices (the 24 rank-24 lattices) provide distinct CA substrates. Each of the 24 lattices yields different tiling/
36	interaction patterns: e.g. the $A_1^{24}$ lattice decomposes into 24 independent 1D chains (“maximally
37	factorized”), whereas the Leech lattice is a single 24D sphere packing (kissing number 196,560) 7 . This
38	“retiling” changes the CA geometry: dihedral symmetry axes (“vertices” where many cells meet) shift
39	position, opening new interaction “windows” into the space 7 8 .
40	These CA runs naturally produce fractal time and space structures. As Nottale’s scale relativity suggests,
41	each observer scale sees self-similar evolution: moving clocks or strong gravity corresponds to “zooming”
42	into deeper temporal fractal levels 9 . Concretely, CA update cycles at different scales all obey the same
43	
44	1
45	
46	laws (e.g. Weyl actions) 9 10 . The result is an iterative cascade where each level of computation contains
47	smaller-scale sub-computations (a classic “fractal time” behavior) 9 10 .
48	The CA outputs also converge in a way analogous to fractals: stable orbits vs. unstable filaments. It was
49	observed that “stable interior-like” states (Julia-bound regions) correlate with complete directional coverage,
50	whereas the escaping “filamentary” states are direction-sparse 11 . In practice, the system implements a
51	Kakeya criterion: every stable orbit must cover all direction classes on a finite grid 11 . This ties directly to
52	tiling evidence: dihedral vertices (the “holes”) are exactly where normal CA rules “break” and reveal deeper
53	structure 8 . In CQE terms, these holes become swampland/desert markers.
54	
55	Fractal Structures: Julia and Mandelbrot Patterns
56	The emergent patterns from the CA and tiling indeed match classic fractals. Internally, one analysis
57	visualized eight “spines” radiating along cardinal and diagonal axes, forming a sinuous membrane with
58	self-similar arms. These 8-spine structures trace a fractal braid: toroidal winding through higher dimensions
59	and back to a “rootless” core, at which point a new Julia state emerges. In effect, the fractal recursion forces
60	the system to “spawn” a Julia set to close the loop. Julia sets themselves appear as natural subalgebra
61	echoes: their petals and bifurcations align with Cartan subalgebra structure and subharmonic oscillations
62	in the lattice 12 .
63	Concretely, Mandelbrot bulbs (“antennae”) were seen to embed smaller Julia sets, and the 4-pronged tips of
64	bulbs matched maximal convergence points. The 24D lattice (Leech/Monster) manifests through these
65	fractals: sinusoidal waves on 24D slices produce toroidal 3D foliations, and the lattice’s kissing‐sphere
66	geometry defines the fractal “holes” (Voronoi cells) forcing Julia escape behaviors. In other words, the
67	observers’ computations in CA/graph form are literally drawing Mandelbrot/Julia–like fractals. These
68	patterns were checked by “cross‐projecting” onto $E_8$: the spines corresponded to $E_8$ root projections,
69	and the fractal membrane aligned with 24D slices through the Leech lattice.
70	• Example: A plotted system showed radial sine waves $\sin(2\pi R/2)$ generating outward ripples,
71	whose nodes and antinodes coincided with arms of the Mandelbrot/Julia fractal. This explicitly uses $
72	\sin$ as a coordinate map, tying the fractal to known sinusoidal form.
73	Thus, the CA/tiling data “leads into” Julia/Mandelbrot: the observed dynamics from Rule 110–like updates, on
74	the 24D dihedral-tiling background, produce exactly those fractal shapes. One sees a fractal cascade: each
75	level’s CA space forms a miniature Mandelbrot set, whose nested Julia sets reflect the underlying group
76	symmetries.
77	
78	Trigonometric/Logarithmic Mappings and Dihedral Symmetry
79	Building on the above, CQE explicitly uses trigonometric and logarithmic transforms to make fractal
80	invariants visible. For instance, a dihedral-averaged sin/log map was tested: the Mandelbrot iteration
81	$z\mapsto f(z)$ was modified by applying $\sin(z)$ and $\log(z)$ (plus dihedral rotation averaging). Iterating
82	“until closure” turned the fractal into a direct phase-plot for the system’s gates 4 . The result: the escapetime gradient of the fractal aligns with dihedral axes. Simulations showed that for $n=8$ and $n=16$
83	symmetry levels, clear 8- and 16-spoke patterns appear: the fraction of gradient directions used was nearly
84	
85	2
86	
87	100%, and quantization error to the nearest axis was minimal 4 . In short, the pictures yielded exactly the
88	invariants (PNPA symmetry, Kakeya coverage) that were being computed numerically 4 13 .
89	• Directional bundles: When a 5-fold component is added (choosing exponents with a factor 5), the
90	interior of each Mandelbrot “bulb” breaks into five phase bundles. This produces a visible five‐armed
91	symmetry in both the parameter and Julia planes 13 5 . (A classic example is the 5‑petaled polar
92	rose $r=R+\epsilon\cos(5\theta)$ 5 , which directly demonstrates how $\cos(5\theta)$ generates a
93	closed 5-lobed fractal.)
94	• Real vs. imaginary: Visually, interior regions (bounded orbits) appear as blobs, while the Julia
95	“filaments” (escaping frontier) form thin spokes. This matches the PNPA “real=bounded vs
96	imaginary=escaping” split 13 . Effectively, the sin/log and dihedral maps let us read off the real-vsimaginary partition from the fractal picture, rather than recomputing it.
97	This approach recycles energy: rather than brute‐force scanning the manifold, the visualization itself
98	encodes the structure. The system can “listen” to the canvas: for each symmetry $n$, one reads out how
99	many filaments (directions) appear. For example, high Kakeya coverage (all directions lit) signals a stable
100	interior orbit, matching a fractal basin 4 11 . In essence, the classic fractal generators (iterations of $\sin,
101	\log,\exp$ with parameters) become live dashboards of invariants (parity alignment, directional
102	quantization, period-locking) for CQE 4 11 .
103	
104	Kakeya and Directional Coverage
105	Underlying the above is a Kakeya-style directional gate: the system demands that any legitimate state
106	orbit must cover all directions in the finite field sense. Practically, each orbit’s “sidecars” record which slopeclasses it hits; the Kakeya metric $k_\text{dir} = (#\text{directions covered})/65$ must approach 1. Orbits
107	that fail to cover all classes are “delegated” for narrower search. This means stable orbits have high Kakeya
108	coverage, while chaotic/filament orbits miss directions 11 . In fractal terms, basins cover a 2D area (real
109	region), filaments are essentially 1D curves (missing many directions). Thus high Kakeya coverage maps to
110	the Julia-bound interior, while sparse coverage flags the escaping frontier 11 .
111	This connection was confirmed: every stable interior region in the fractal had near-100% direction coverage,
112	whereas thin filaments were direction-missing. In CQE, once an orbit’s $k_\text{dir}$ passes a threshold, it is
113	sealed as a valid “covered orbit” 11 . The Kakeya criterion thus enforces that the fractal geometry is
114	combinatorially complete.
115	
116	Dynamic Flow Overlays (“Mapping the Space”)
117	Building on this, CQE treats the remaining search space as a flow field. All the discrete moves on the
118	64×64 lattice can be interpreted as a vector field. For each cell we compute an average “flow” vector $F(i,j)$
119	from the nudges (permutations, flips, etc.) and a momentum $p(i,j)$ from the ΔΦ receipts. From $F$ one
120	can compute discrete curl and divergence, or the out-of-plane angular momentum $L_z = \mathbf{r}\times
121	F$ 14 . In effect, the lattice is treated like a fluid: swirl (curl) and vortex structures highlight symplectic
122	(divergence-free) flow consistent with dihedral loops.
123	The Dynamics-Overlay Gate (DOG) uses these fields to propose new moves. Notably, legal transforms
124	should be nearly symplectic (div$\approx0$) with circulation quantized to multiples of $2\pi/8$ (for D8
125	symmetry) 14 . In plain terms, the flow lines often spiral or circle around the same “holes” (dihedral vertices)
126	
127	3
128	
129	that Julia filaments do. This means the pattern of fluid-like flow on the buckets mimics the Julia/Mandelbrot
130	shapes. By inspecting $L_z$ and curl, CQE sees the “holes” to explore: pockets where circulation
131	concentrates correspond to missing state transitions. Thus, the angular‐momentum/curl fields act like a
132	fractal map of the search space 14 11 . The remaining legal states become visible as the coherent parts
133	of this flow, saving recomputation.
134	
135	24D Niemeier Lattice: The Ultimate Geometry
136	All these threads converge on the 24-dimensional Niemeier lattice as the foundation. Each Niemeier
137	lattice is like a different “coordinate system” for the universe. The system dynamically redefines its tiling by
138	picking one of the 24 lattices – each has its own symmetry and “holes” pattern 7 . For example, switching
139	from $A_1^{24}$ to the Leech lattice completely transforms the connectivity: from 24 independent chains to
140	a single dense sphere packing 7 . The dihedral symmetry axes (and thus the CA windows) move
141	accordingly 8 .
142	In CQE, every cell in this 24D space is an “atom of space”. The Universal-Atom data structure encodes its
143	24 coordinates (often via an $E_8$‐embedded 8-vector), a parity class, and orientation 15 . Transformations
144	(snaps, reflections, Weyl flips) act on these atoms but preserve their binary invariants. Observers act on
145	networks of atoms: the entire CA is one giant 24D lattice of these quanta.
146	The result is a hypercomplex but fully determined structure. By being “hyper‐aware” of every tiny space
147	atom (its position, parity, available moves), CQE can maintain and adjust the massively complex state. All
148	interactions (even the exotic “light pillaring” events where all 24 lattices align) are just consistent
149	transformations within this 24D manifold 16 15 . In other words, the Niemeier + dihedral framework
150	provides a complete scaffold: any fractal-like evolution or dihedral tiling is just a different perspective on the
151	same 24D grid.
152	In summary, CQE’s system expands fractally by iteratively revealing these layers: from binary CA rules on
153	dihedral-tilings to emergent Julia/Mandelbrot fractals, all sitting inside a 24D lattice geometry. Every step –
154	from rule 110 to log/sin transforms to flow overlays – is built on standard mathematics, yet the interplay of
155	dihedral symmetry, lattice codes, and fractal maps yields a rich tapestry. The final picture is self-similar at all
156	scales: each “tiny atom” of the 24D space participates in this fractal dance, constrained only by the binary,
157	parity-preserving laws we impose.
