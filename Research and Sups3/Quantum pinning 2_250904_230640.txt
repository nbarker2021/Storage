Quantum Pinning Phenomena Across Various Physical Systems
1. Theoretical Foundations of Quantum Pinning
Collective vs. Individual Pinning: Pinning of an ordered state (vortex lattice, charge density wave, Wigner crystal, etc.) can be described by collective pinning theory. In this framework, many particles or an elastic medium are weakly pinned by many defects, leading to a disordered but metastable energy landscape with many local minima. On large length scales this yields a glassy pinned state. By contrast, in strong pinning (individual pinning), a few defects dominate, trapping individual vortices or local distortions. The classic Larkin-Ovchinnikov collective pinning theory and the Fukuyama-Lee-Rice (FLR) model (originally for charge-density waves) describe how an elastic medium is pinned by a random impurity potential. The FLR model, for example, treats an incommensurate CDW as an elastic medium subject to a weak random potential, predicting a threshold field below which the CDW remains pinned (zero average velocity) and above which it slides. Importantly, these models in their simplest form assume thermal activation or static behavior at $T=0$. Quantum extensions introduce the possibility of tunneling out of pinning wells even at zero temperature.
Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling and Quantum Creep: At finite temperature, thermal activation causes pinned objects to hop between metastable states (“creep”). As temperature is lowered, quantum tunneling can provide an alternate pathway for escape from pinning wells – a phenomenon known as quantum creep. In a quantum picture, the pinned object’s coordinate behaves as a collective degree of freedom that can tunnel through the energy barrier via WKB (Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin) instanton processes. This is essentially macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT), where a large collection of particles (or a field configuration) tunnels as a whole. Theoretical work shows that quantum creep can be viewed as tunneling between metastable configurations in the complex time plane. The crossover from thermal activation to quantum tunneling occurs at a characteristic temperature $T_q$, where the thermal energy $k_B T$ becomes comparable to the level splitting or attempt frequency for quantum escape. Below this crossover, the escape rate becomes temperature-independent, governed by the quantum tunneling rate (with an Arrhenius-like thermal factor replaced by a WKB exponent). Criteria for this thermal–quantum crossover have been derived for various systems. For example, in superconducting vortices (see §3.1), a crossover to quantum creep might occur at a few kelvin, whereas for magnetic skyrmions (see §3.4) theoretical estimates place the crossover in the millikelvin range. When observing creep as a function of temperature, one expects an Arrhenius-like decrease of the creep rate with $1/T$ that saturates at $T_q$, forming a plateau of temperature-independent creep – a clear signature of quantum tunneling taking over.
Models of Quantum Depinning: Several theoretical models capture quantum depinning. One approach is to compute the tunnel splitting or escape rate from a single pinning well using the WKB approximation or instanton methods. For instance, quantum tunneling out of a collective pinning well was addressed by Blatter et al. (1991) for superconducting vortex bundles. In the regime of weak collective pinning, the elastic energy cost of a pinned object (vortex lattice section, CDW segment, etc.) escaping a defect is balanced against the impurity potential, and the tunneling rate can be estimated by a Euclidean action. Notably, dissipation plays a crucial role: coupling to a dissipative bath (e.g. normal electrons in a superconductor, or phonons) can damp quantum tunneling (Caldeira-Leggett mechanism), effectively increasing the action. In Blatter’s analysis of vortex tunneling, a key dimensionless parameter was the ratio of normal-state resistivity $\rho_n$ to the superconducting coherence length $\xi$ (related to dissipation strength); strong tunneling was predicted when $\rho_n/\xi \gtrsim 1~\text{k}\Omega$, indicating low intrinsic dissipation. More generally, underdamped systems (low dissipation, or thin insulating magnets for skyrmions) favor quantum tunneling, whereas overdamped systems (high viscosity) suppress coherent tunneling. Disorder strength also matters: a deeper or larger pinning potential yields a larger barrier, suppressing tunneling exponentially, whereas a shallow or narrow pin (or a collectively reduced barrier due to many-body effects) enhances tunneling probability.
Dimensionality and Collective Coordinates: The dimensionality and symmetry of the system strongly influence quantum pinning phenomena. In lower-dimensional systems, collective excitations often have lower energy barriers and fewer degrees of freedom to coordinate, making quantum effects more pronounced. For example, a one-dimensional CDW (essentially a single phase coordinate along a chain) can exhibit quantum phase slips more readily than a three-dimensional CDW, where a large volume would have to tunnel in unison. In 2D systems like thin superconducting films or Wigner crystals, the entire object (vortex or electron lattice) can sometimes be treated as a single quantum particle coordinate. In higher dimensions, tunneling might proceed via nucleation of a localized defect (e.g. a small vortex loop or a soliton segment) that then allows the system to reconfigure – effectively reducing the collective tunneling to a lower-dimensional event. Symmetry considerations are also crucial: if the pinned state is incommensurate with the underlying lattice or substrate, it possesses a continuous translational symmetry (neglecting disorder) and can exhibit zero static friction at $T=0$ (an analog of the Aubry superlubricity condition). By contrast, a commensurate pinned state is locked by lattice periodicity. The effect of commensurability on quantum pinning has been highlighted in recent theoretical work on moiré systems: perfectly commensurate charge solids remain pinned, whereas incommensurate solids have greatly reduced depinning thresholds even at zero temperature. Internal symmetries can come into play as well – for example, a magnetic skyrmion has an internal spin winding (helicity) that could in principle tunnel between equivalent orientations, representing a quantum transition between two degenerate states (this has been proposed as a qubit degree of freedom in skyrmion-based quantum computing concepts).
Dissipation and Environment: As noted, dissipation (coupling to gapless modes) can suppress quantum coherence. In the context of vortices and skyrmions, an Ohmic dissipative term adds to the action and can exponentially reduce tunneling rates. Conversely, in some cases a moderate damping can help the system stay in a potential well long enough to tunnel (preventing escape by thermal activation). The role of the Hall (magnus) force versus damping is important: for instance, the Hall angle of vortex motion (ratio of reactive to dissipative forces) can influence whether tunneling trajectories pick up a Berry phase. A striking example is a skyrmion in an insulating magnet: in the limit of negligible mass and predominant Magnus force, its dynamics map to that of a charged particle in a magnetic field. In that case, the quantum tunneling problem yields a discrete Landau level spectrum within the pinning potential (with the skyrmion’s center-of-mass motion quantized). Dissipation from conduction electrons is removed in an insulator, enabling quantum behavior for sufficiently small skyrmions. In summary, low dissipation, lower dimensionality, weaker pinning (or quantum-facilitating symmetry), and smaller effective mass all tilt a system toward the quantum pinning regime.
2. Experimental Methods and Signatures of Quantum Pinning
Identifying quantum pinning phenomena requires careful measurement of dynamics at ultra-low temperatures and often at very small drive forces. Several experimental techniques have been developed to probe the pinning and depinning of various systems:
• Magnetization Relaxation (Flux Creep): In type-II superconductors, one classic method is to measure how the magnetic moment (trapped flux) decays over time. A logarithmic decay of magnetization is a hallmark of thermally activated flux creep. In the quantum regime, one expects the relaxation rate to become independent of temperature, i.e. the magnetization decay persists even as $T \to 0$. Experiments on high-$T_c$ cuprates and other superconductors have indeed observed a plateau in the creep rate at the lowest temperatures, suggestive of quantum tunneling of vortices. Theoretical calculations of vortex relaxation rates including quantum tunneling have been compared to such data. Magnetization relaxation is a sensitive probe because even extremely slow creep (years-long time constants) can be detected as a small change in magnetization. A deviation from Arrhenius temperature dependence (flattening of the log(time) decay rate) is interpreted as evidence for macroscopic quantum tunneling of flux lines (see §3.1).
• AC Linear Response – Campbell Penetration Depth: A small AC magnetic field can be used to probe the Campbell penetration depth, $\lambda_{\text{Campbell}}$, which characterizes how far an AC field penetrates into a pinned lattice (e.g. vortex lattice) without depinning the structures. In the linear regime, vortices oscillate within their pinning potentials. The Campbell depth is related to the curvature of the pinning potential (the effective spring constant binding the vortex to its pin). Measuring $\lambda_{\text{Campbell}}(T, B)$ via AC susceptibility or inductance provides information on the pinning strength and the size of the effective oscillation amplitudes. Anomalies or plateaus in $\lambda_{\text{Campbell}}(T)$ at low $T$ can signal when vortex vibrations are limited by quantum constraints rather than thermal hopping. Recent derivations of the Campbell response in both strong and collective pinning regimes have enabled quantitative interpretation of such measurements. Though this technique primarily probes the elastic aspects of pinning (small oscillations), a temperature-independent Campbell stiffness at low $T$ might indicate that thermal softening is replaced by quantum zero-point motion in the wells.
• RF/Microwave Pinning-Mode Spectroscopy: A definitive signature of a pinned crystal is the observation of a pinning mode resonance – a collective oscillation of the pinned lattice within the impurity potential. This is commonly observed in Wigner crystal phases of 2D electrons in high magnetic fields: microwave absorption shows a resonance at frequency $f_p$ corresponding to the pinning oscillation frequency. The pinning mode is essentially an oscillation of the center-of-mass of the electron solid within the potential wells of disorder. It typically appears as a peak in the real part of the AC conductivity $\sigma_{xx}(f)$ or a resonance in dielectric loss. Importantly, a temperature-independent pinning mode frequency (and a Q-factor that does not vanish as $T\to0$) is a hallmark that the solid remains intact and pinned by quantum mechanisms even at zero thermal energy. In 2D electron systems, pinning resonances on the order of tens to hundreds of MHz have been measured down to $T\sim50$ mK. The existence of such a well-defined mode, persisting to the lowest $T$, implies that the electron solid is undergoing small oscillatory motion in a stable potential – consistent with a quantum pinned solid. Similar pinning-mode resonances have been sought in other systems: e.g. a charge-density wave (CDW) in a crystal has an analog called the phason mode, which, when pinned by impurities, becomes gapped (a pinned phason). In dielectric or microwave spectra of CDW materials, one can observe a resonant absorption or dispersion at the pinned phason frequency (typically in the GHz or THz range). Observing that this mode does not soften as $T\to0$ would indicate quantum pinning of the CDW. Another example is the predicted microwave absorption by quantized skyrmion motion (if a skyrmion in a potential well has discrete harmonic oscillator levels, transitions between them could absorb microwaves – though this remains a theoretical proposal).
• Nonlinear Transport (IV characteristics): Perhaps the most direct evidence of depinning is obtained from nonlinear DC transport. In a pinned state, a small applied force (current or electric field) yields zero steady-state motion (zero voltage in a superconductor or zero current in an insulating electron crystal). Once the drive exceeds a threshold (critical current $J_c$ or threshold field $E_T$), the system depins and a finite voltage or current appears. This behavior is well known in CDWs (the classic sliding CDW exhibits a threshold electric field), vortex lattices (critical currents for flux flow), and Wigner solids (threshold for onset of conduction). Quantum tunneling can manifest as sub-threshold conduction: a tiny current (or finite residual voltage) even when the drive is below the classical threshold. This can occur via quantum tunneling of small sections (for instance, phase slips in a CDW or tunneling of individual vortices between pins) that produce occasional motion. Such sub-threshold currents are typically extremely small and often accompanied by telegraph noise or stochastic jumps. Sensitive measurements in CDW systems have indeed detected creep currents below $E_T$ that become temperature-independent at the lowest $T$, consistent with quantum depinning events. One dramatic example in CDWs is the observation of oscillatory transport in ring-shaped crystals of TaS$_3$ under magnetic field: the CDW current showed oscillations as a function of flux, indicating quantum interference of tunnel paths around the ring. This Aharonov-Bohm-type effect *“demands a quantum interpretation”*, confirming that the CDW charge is tunneling collectively (maintaining phase coherence around the ring). In general, plotting $I$–$V$ curves at various low temperatures and seeing them converge onto a single temperature-independent curve (often with a power-law or exponential form characteristic of tunneling) is strong evidence of quantum depinning. Recently, in 2D electron solids, transport studies have revealed a residual conductivity at $T\to0$ that is attributed to quantum motion of the electron crystal (often called a “quantum fluid” or “quantum solid” regime).
• Noise and Spectroscopy of Fluctuations: The dynamical state of a pinned system can also be characterized by its noise spectrum. When depinning occurs via intermittent jumps (either thermally activated or quantum tunneling events), a broad-spectrum noise (telegraph noise or $1/f$ noise) is often observed. In CDWs, once sliding begins, the system can exhibit narrow-band noise: a sharp frequency in the voltage noise associated with the periodic passage of CDW solitons (a classical effect). In the quantum regime, one might instead see a noise floor that does not vanish as $T\to0$. For example, experiments have measured voltage noise in the insulating state of 2D electron systems near the onset of Wigner crystallization. Enhanced noise near the putative depinning threshold can signal quantum creep events even when the average current is zero. Similarly, in superconductors, flux tunneling events can produce bursts of flux motion (flux avalanches) that are seen as noise in magnetization or inductance. Monitoring such noise as a function of temperature can reveal a transition from thermally dominated avalanches to quantum-dominated ones. Another technique, particularly relevant for vortices and skyrmions, is microscopy of motion – e.g. using scanning tunneling microscopy or magneto-optical imaging to directly watch the motion of vortices. If vortices hop appreciably even at the lowest temperatures, one can sometimes directly visualize their quantum creep (though in practice thermal and quantum hops are hard to distinguish visually). Still, such imaging can at least confirm that the system is not completely frozen at low $T$.
In summary, an array of techniques – from global transport measurements (magnetization, $I$–$V$ curves) to local or spectroscopic probes (noise spectra, AC resonances) – are employed to identify quantum pinning. The clearest signatures include temperature-independent relaxations or resonances, finite sub-threshold motion at $T=0$, and in special cases, quantum coherence effects like interference in tunneling paths. Each physical system often requires a tailored approach (for instance, microwave spectroscopy for Wigner solids, transport for CDWs, magnetometry for vortices), as described next for specific systems.
3. System-Specific Analysis of Quantum Pinning
3.1 Superconducting Vortices (Type-II Superconductors)
In type-II superconductors, magnetic flux penetrates in quantized tubes called vortices which form a lattice. Pinning of these vortices by material defects is crucial for sustaining superconductivity under current (to prevent flux flow dissipation). Classically, vortices creep via thermal activation over pinning barriers, leading to a slow decay of critical current or magnetization over time. However, at low enough temperature, quantum tunneling of vortices can occur – effectively vortices hopping between pinning sites through quantum barrier penetration. This was one of the earliest proposed macroscopic quantum phenomena (sometimes dubbed “vortex tunneling” or “quantum flux creep”). Theoretically, the vortex lattice in a bulk superconductor can be described by collective pinning; at low temperatures, Blatter et al. showed that quantum collective creep should set in, with a tunneling rate governed by materials parameters like coherence length and normal-state resistivity. In moderate fields, individual vortex lines tunnel, whereas at higher fields small bundles of vortices may tunnel collectively. Experimentally, high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors provided an ideal testbed: due to their high transition temperatures, one can measure creep down to very low $T/T_c$. Measurements of magnetization relaxation in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ and Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_8$ indeed found that below a few kelvin, the apparent activation energy $U(T)$ plateaued instead of diverging – a sign that quantum creep dominates. The crossover temperature in YBCO was on the order of $T_q \sim 5$–$10$ K in some studies. Below this, the flux creep rate became only weakly $T$-dependent, consistent with quantum tunneling of vortex segments. Additionally, experiments in low-$T_c$ superconductors at millikelvin temperatures (e.g. Nb or PbIn alloys) have observed residual dissipation attributable to quantum vortex hopping.
One signature of quantum vortex motion is the survival of finite resistivity as $T\to0$ in a magnetic field – an effect connected to the concept of a vortex glass. In an ideal vortex glass phase, one expects zero linear resistivity even at finite temperature (due to infinitely slow creep in the thermodynamic limit). However, quantum tunneling provides a mechanism for vortices to diffuse even at $T=0$, implying that true superconductivity might be destroyed by quantum creep in two dimensions. This scenario has been discussed as a possible explanation for the puzzling “quantum metallic state” observed in some disordered 2D superconducting films: instead of a complete superconducting transition, the film enters a low but finite resistance state at low $T$, possibly due to quantum motion of vortices. In three-dimensional superconductors, quantum tunneling of an entire vortex line is a formidable action (because the line is an extended object). Often the tunneling occurs via nucleation of a vortex loop: a small loop of vortex line materializes via quantum fluctuation and expands, enabling flux to redistribute. In layered or anisotropic superconductors, tunneling may involve a single pancake vortex hopping between pinning sites in adjacent CuO$_2$ layers (assisted by Josephson coupling between layers). Theoretical treatments for such systems (e.g. the Kim and Shin analysis for anisotropic superconductors) explicitly calculate the crossover temperature between thermal activation and quantum tunneling, and find reasonable agreement with experimental values.
Dissipative couplings (like the normal electrons and phonons) modify vortex tunneling. In the limit of strong intrinsic damping (large normal-state conductivity), the quantum transition may be overdamped, suppressing MQT. However, if the normal electron viscosity is not too high (as characterized by the parameter in Blatter’s work, $\rho_n/\xi$), vortices can tunnel frequently. One interesting aspect of vortex quantum creep is the role of the Hall effect: a vortex moving quantum-mechanically can have a Magnus (Lorentz force) component; this has been theoretically studied and indicates that tunneling may prefer certain directions (or frequencies) if Hall dynamics are significant. Practically, vortex quantum tunneling remains a subtle effect – it does not lead to dramatic discontinuities, but rather a smooth continuation of creep to $T=0$. The evidence today for quantum vortex creep is seen in the persistent logarithmic relaxations in high-$T_c$ materials at the lowest temperatures and the existence of a finite residual resistance in some extreme type-II materials at $T\approx0$. These observations align with the notion that vortices undergo macroscopic quantum tunneling out of pinning wells at low $T$.
3.2 Charge Density Waves (CDWs)
Charge density waves – periodic modulations of electron density often accompanied by lattice distortion – are known to pin to impurities in a host crystal. A pristine CDW can slide without resistance (analogous to a superfluid of electron-hole pairs), but disorder pins the phase of the CDW, leading to a finite threshold field $E_T$ to set it in motion. The Fukuyama-Lee-Rice (FLR) model (1978) was a landmark theoretical framework describing how a weak, random impurity potential pins an incommensurate CDW, resulting in a collective pinning of the CDW phase. According to FLR, at $T=0$ a CDW is truly static below $E_T$. However, quantum tunneling can violate this classical expectation. Essentially, phase slips or solitons in the CDW can nucleate via quantum fluctuations, allowing the CDW to creep at zero temperature. Each phase slip advances the CDW phase by $2\pi$ (one wavelength), transferring charge across the sample. While a single 2$\pi$ slip may involve only a small region (e.g. one CDW wavelength wide), the long-range Coulomb interactions and Peierls gap make collective tunneling non-trivial. Nonetheless, experimental hints of quantum depinning in CDWs have emerged.
One of the most striking pieces of evidence came from experiments by Tanda et al. on ring-shaped TaS$_3$ samples. They observed oscillations in the CDW conductance as a function of applied magnetic flux threading the ring, analogous to h/e periodicity in a superconducting loop. This implies that the CDW charge is tunneling around the ring coherently (maintaining phase coherence), picking up a quantum phase dependent on the magnetic flux – a phenomenon that cannot be explained by classical creep. As noted by the researchers, these oscillations “not only support, but demand, a quantum interpretation” of CDW transport. In linear (non-loop) samples, evidence for quantum tunneling is more indirect: typically, one looks for sub-threshold CDW currents at low $T$. High-precision transport studies on materials like NbSe$_3$ and $o$-TaS$_3$ have found that below a certain temperature (a few kelvin, varying per material), the nominally insulating state (no CDW current classically below $E_T$) gives way to an extremely slow current that is independent of further temperature reduction. This residual current can be orders of magnitude smaller than the above-threshold current, but its presence indicates that the CDW is not completely pinned – instead, rare tunneling events allow it to slip. Often, these tunneling events manifest in noise: the CDW current is irregular and exhibits broad-spectrum noise due to stochastic phase-slip events. If the statistics of these events (e.g. their rate) stop depending on temperature at low $T$, it reinforces the quantum tunneling hypothesis.
Another signature to consider is the nonlinear $I$–$V$ shape at the very onset of motion. In thermal creep, one expects an activated behavior $I \sim \exp[-U/k_BT]$ for $E \ll E_T$, which essentially vanishes as $T\to0$. In quantum creep, one might expect $I \sim \exp(-S/\hbar)$ where $S$ is the imaginary-time action of the tunneling event – a constant at low $T$. Thus, a finite slope in the $I$–$V$ curve at $T=0$ (or a power-law $I \propto E^\alpha$ with $\alpha<\infty$) can indicate quantum depinning. Indeed, some experiments have reported a power-law conductivity $\sigma \sim E^\alpha$ in the insulating CDW state at very low temperatures, whereas classical models would predict a true gap (infinite $\alpha$) at $T=0$.
Furthermore, the role of commensurability is important in CDWs. If a CDW is commensurate with the lattice (lock-in to lattice periodicity), it is typically much harder to depin (the pinning is built-in by the lattice potential, not just by disorder). Incommensurate CDWs, however, have a continuous translational symmetry of the order parameter and hence can, in principle, slide freely if not for disorder. Thus incommensurate CDWs are more prone to depinning and quantum creep. Quasi-1D CDW compounds (like NbSe$_3$, (TaSe$_4$)$_2$I) are usually incommensurate and indeed show sliding behavior. In 2D or 3D CDWs (e.g. in layered dichalcogenides like 2H-NbSe$_2$ or 1T-TiSe$_2$), commensurability and multi-axis ordering can make the pinning landscape richer. There is ongoing research into whether these systems at low $T$ exhibit tunneling-assisted depinning (for instance, in 2H-NbSe$_2$ under pressure, a quantum melting of the CDW has been observed, hinting the boundary of the CDW phase might be influenced by quantum fluctuations).
In summary, CDWs provide a platform where collective quantum tunneling of electron charge can occur. The evidence ranges from quantum interference in CDW rings to temperature-independent sub-threshold currents and noise. The concept that the Schrödinger equation of the CDW condensate can play the role of the “classical” equation of motion for the macroscopic CDW has been proposed – an intriguing analogy to superconductivity. This blurs the line between classical and quantum descriptions, suggesting that even at high temperatures (some CDWs exist up to 100 K), quantum coherence may significantly affect behavior. The broader implication is that CDWs might serve as model systems for studying macroscopic quantum phenomena in electronic crystals, potentially informing our understanding of other collective electron states.
3.3 Electron Wigner Crystals in the Quantum Hall Regime
A Wigner crystal is an electron solid that forms when the kinetic energy of electrons is overwhelmed by their mutual Coulomb repulsion, causing them to localize on lattice sites. In two-dimensional electron systems (2DES) at low density and high magnetic field, Wigner crystallization has been experimentally realized. These electron crystals are pinned by the inevitable disorder in the host semiconductor (e.g. GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures). The pinning is weak (since the electron solid is delicate), which allows the observation of rich dynamical phenomena, including quantum depinning.
The primary signature of a pinned Wigner crystal in a 2DES (at filling factors $ν \ll 1$) is an insulating DC transport and a characteristic resonance in AC conductivity – the pinning mode. This was first observed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. For example, Williams et al. (1991) reported a threshold electric field for conduction and a microwave resonance around a few hundred MHz in a magnetic-field-induced Wigner solid of electrons on GaAs. The resonance frequency $f_p$ depends on the pinning strength and the effective mass of the crystal (which in high field is related to the magnetophonon stiffness). A crucial observation is that this pinning mode remains well-defined at the lowest temperatures (tens of mK), with its frequency $f_p$ often only weakly dependent on temperature – indicating that thermal activation is not needed to explore the confining potential; the electrons are essentially oscillating in their pinning wells quantum-mechanically. In some cases, as temperature is lowered, the pinning mode actually shifts in frequency or increases in amplitude, which can happen if the crystal becomes more ordered and the effective pinning stiffness increases (since fewer thermally excited defects or dislocations are present). But eventually, a low-$T$ saturation of $f_p$ is typically seen, consistent with a quantum ground state of the pinned crystal.
On the DC side, a classic Wigner crystal shows a sharp onset of conduction at an applied electric field $E_T$. For 2D electron Wigner crystals in GaAs, $E_T$ might be extremely small (since disorder is weak in high-mobility samples, e.g. $E_T$ of order $10^{-3}$–$10^{-2}$ V/cm). Below $E_T$, no steady current flows in classical terms. However, recent studies have revealed that as one approaches millikelvin temperatures, these 2D electron solids do conduct ever so slightly (and non-linearly) below $E_T$. Transport evidence for a “quantum electron solid” sliding was reported by Brus  et al. (2018), who observed a finite conductivity appearing in the limit of zero temperature in a low-density 2DES, suggesting that the Wigner solid does not remain completely pinned. More recently, high-quality 2D electron systems have shown collective depinning and re-entrant melting phenomena: for instance, a 2023 experiment demonstrated that when the Wigner solid depins under drive, it can do so in stages – first flowing as an ordered solid and then eventually disordering at higher currents. The fact that a moving crystal phase is observed (rather than immediate melting) implies that quantum and thermal fluctuations were not enough to immediately destroy order at depinning, which is consistent with a collective, coherent depinning process rather than random independent hops.
Noise measurements in the Wigner crystal state also support the presence of quantum creep. At small drives ($E < E_T$), one can detect displacement currents and noise due to momentary hops of the electron lattice. The noise spectrum often shows a broadband component that persists to the lowest temperatures. Some experiments have also employed single-electron transistors as local electrometers to sense any local motion of electrons in the pinned solid. If electrons tunnel or hop quantum-mechanically, the resulting charge reconfiguration can be picked up as telegraph signals.
An interesting aspect unique to Wigner crystals in the quantum Hall effect is the interplay with quantum Hall liquid states. For example, near Landau level filling $ν \approx 1/5$, there is a competition between a Wigner solid and a fractional quantum Hall liquid. The solid is pinned and insulating, while the liquid has quantized Hall conductance. As parameters (density or magnetic field) are tuned, one can have a transition between these states. Some transport anomalies, like a non-zero longitudinal conductivity extrapolated to $T=0$ in the insulating phase, could be explained by quantum fluctuations of the Wigner crystal (quantum melting into the liquid or sliding within the disorder). Indeed, a quantum phase transition between a pinned solid and a quantum Hall liquid is a topic of current research. Disorder is believed to round this transition, possibly through a Griffiths-phase scenario where rare regions of liquid allow conduction in the solid background (a quantum Griffiths insulator). In any case, understanding the low-$T$ limit of these insulators is an essential part of quantum pinning physics.
In summary, 2D Wigner crystals in high magnetic fields stand as a clean realization of a pinned quantum solid. Hallmarks of quantum pinning in these systems include: a pinning-mode resonance that persists to $T\to 0$, evidence of finite conductivity at $T=0$ (through collective tunneling), and nonlinear transport with multiple depinning regimes indicating the quantumly assisted motion of different defect modes (like kinks or domain walls). These studies not only illuminate electron solid behavior but are also relevant for understanding other charge-ordered systems such as those in moiré materials (next section).
3.4 Magnetic Skyrmions
Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale spin textures – essentially whirlpools of magnetization – that behave like particle-like solitons in magnetic materials. They have garnered interest for their potential in information storage and logic devices due to their stability and small size. In most experiments so far, skyrmions (typically 10–100 nm in diameter) are manipulated at finite temperature and behave classically under the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion. However, theoretical proposals suggest that small skyrmions in insulating magnets can exhibit quantum dynamics, including quantized motion in pinning potentials and quantum tunneling through energy barriers.
The key insight is that an isolated skyrmion in a ferromagnet possesses a well-defined translational zero mode (its center position) and, because of its topological nature, experiences a Magnus (gyrocropic) force when moving – mathematically analogous to a charged particle in a magnetic field. As a result, if a skyrmion is confined in a potential well (for example, created by a defect or a nanostructured pinning site), its translational motion can be quantized into discrete energy levels, much like Landau levels. Shi-Zeng Lin and colleagues predicted in 2013 that a skyrmion in a chiral magnet could occupy a quantized orbital state within a pinning potential, and transitions between these quantized levels could potentially be observed via microwave absorption. Essentially, the lowest Landau level of the skyrmion (which corresponds to circular orbits around the pin center) is split by the presence of the potential into a ladder of states characterized by angular momentum. For a skyrmion of sufficiently small size (comprising a few thousand spins), the energy spacing of these levels might be on the order of $\mu$eV to meV, making it feasible to see resonance at GHz to THz frequencies.
Quantum depinning of skyrmions refers to the skyrmion tunneling out of a pinning potential. A recent theoretical study by Psaroudaki and Loss (2020) computed the WKB tunneling rate for a skyrmion escaping a defect potential under the influence of a tilted magnetic field (which provides a constant force on the skyrmion). They treated the skyrmion as a massless particle dominated by the Magnus force and found a universal form for the tunneling exponent and the crossover temperature between thermal activation and quantum tunneling. Importantly, they concluded that for skyrmions of radius on the order of ~10 lattice constants (in a material like Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$), quantum behavior could become relevant at temperatures in the millikelvin range. In other words, if one could cool an insulating skyrmion-hosting magnet to say 50 mK, a skyrmion pinned by a nanoscale defect might spontaneously tunnel out, rather than needing any thermal kick. The crossover temperature in their estimate was extremely low (much lower than for vortices or CDWs) due to the relatively large mass (or effective action) of even a small skyrmion. Nonetheless, small skyrmions (e.g. those stabilized by strong anisotropy or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in certain materials) minimize that action by reducing the number of spins involved in the tunneling event.
Another quantum aspect of skyrmions is their internal degrees of freedom, such as the helicity (the angle of the in-plane spin winding). In some systems, skyrmions have a preferred helicity (due to anisotropic energy terms), but in others helicity is a soft mode. Quantum tunneling between different helicity states is analogous to a particle’s spin tunneling between up/down – it has been proposed and studied theoretically. For example, a skyrmion might tunnel between a Néel-type configuration and an equivalent one rotated by 180°, which is a macroscopic change in the magnetization texture. Such tunneling would be extremely slow (likely astronomically small rates if the barrier is not small), but it’s conceptually interesting as it would constitute a macroscopic spin tunneling phenomenon.
Experimentally, direct evidence of quantum effects in skyrmions is still lacking, largely because experiments have not yet been done in the extreme conditions (ultra-low $T$, very controlled pinning) required. However, there are some suggestive observations. The stochastic creation or annihilation of skyrmions at very low temperatures could be one area to watch: if skyrmions disappear below a certain size or are created without thermal activation, it might hint at quantum nucleation. Additionally, efforts in using microwave spectroscopy to detect skyrmion resonant modes are underway; if quantum confined levels exist, one might see multiple resonances or a change in mode spectrum as $T$ decreases. Another indirect route is via ultra-sensitive torque magnetometry or noise measurements in a skyrmion lattice state – any unexplained dissipative or tunneling-like signals at the lowest temperatures might indicate quantum motion of individual skyrmions or small clusters.
In broader terms, quantum pinning of skyrmions is of great interest for potential quantum technologies. If one could reliably create a skyrmion in a metastable position and rely on quantum tunneling for it to appear elsewhere (or to encode quantum information in a superposition of positions or helicities), it opens doors to using skyrmions in quantum computing or as stochastic bits in quantum neuromorphic computing. While these ideas are speculative, they underscore the point that skyrmions are not fundamentally excluded from the realm of quantum mechanics. With radii of a few nanometers, a skyrmion is a mesoscopic object – large, but composed of a finite number of spins. Psaroudaki et al. note that a skyrmion with ~1000 spins can act quantum mechanically at sufficiently low $T$. This is reminiscent of molecular nanomagnets (like Mn-12 acetate) which also involve ~10$^3$ spins and display quantum tunneling of magnetization. It suggests that future experiments on quantum skyrmions could indeed observe phenomena like MQT escape from pinning, quantized mode splitting, and quantum coherence between skyrmion states.
3.5 Moiré and Generalized Wigner Crystals
Moiré materials (such as twisted bilayer graphene, or transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers) often feature flat electronic bands and strong interactions, leading to a variety of correlated insulating states at fractional fillings of the moiré lattice. These insulators can sometimes be interpreted as generalized Wigner crystals – electrons (or holes) localized in a periodic pattern that may or may not coincide with the underlying moiré superlattice. Because the moiré superlattice itself is a periodic potential for the electrons, these systems realize a crystal (of electrons) on another crystal (the moiré lattice). This is an ideal playground to study commensurate vs incommensurate pinning phenomena, with the twist that both the “substrate” and the “solid” can be tuned by gate voltage (filling factor) and twist angle.
In such systems, at certain rational fillings (e.g. $1/3, 1/2, 2/3$ of the moiré lattice), the electron crystal is commensurate with the moiré pattern and is expected to be strongly pinned (gapped). At non-rational fillings, the electron positions form an incommensurate pattern relative to the moiré potential, which can lead to dramatically weaker pinning – analogous to a charge-density wave that is incommensurate with a host lattice. Recent numerical simulations by Reichhardt and Reichhardt (2025) examined this scenario and found clear distinctions. For commensurate fillings (like exactly 1/3), they found a strongly pinned static state at $T=0$, which only depins when the external drive exceeds a certain threshold. In contrast, for incommensurate fillings (say 0.31 or 0.35, near 1/3 but doped with extra particles or holes), the depinning threshold is greatly reduced. Essentially, the presence of solitons or domain walls (sometimes called kinks/antikinks in a 1D analogy) in the incommensurate structure allows parts of the crystal to slide at much lower forces. The simulation even showed a two-step depinning for incommensurate cases: first, the extra charges (or vacancies) start moving – e.g. an “antikink flow” along the charge stripes in the 1/2-filling case – and then at a higher drive the entire crystal moves. This two-stage process has a clear fingerprint in the velocity–force curves (a plateau or inflection between two critical forces) and would be a hallmark of quantum plasticity if observed experimentally.
At finite temperatures, the same study found that an applied drive can effectively reduce the melting temperature of the commensurate crystal (since motion induces disorder) and conversely enhance creep in the incommensurate crystal. This indicates that even thermally, the incommensurate states are much easier to depin – which one can extrapolate to $T=0$: the commensurate state might remain pinned (no creep) while the incommensurate state exhibits quantum creep readily. One can think of this as a “quantum Aubry transition” in 2D: the Aubry transition in 1D is when an incommensurate chain goes from pinned (at large substrate strength) to sliding (at low substrate strength) due to the breaking of analyticity. Here, instead of substrate strength, it’s the filling that determines commensurability. If experiments could realize ultra-low temperature transport in these moiré crystals, one might see a finite conductivity at $T=0$ whenever the filling is off commensurate, signaling quantum depinning via the motion of domain walls or interstitials. Commensurate fillings should act as true insulators at $T=0$ (ignoring extrinsic tunneling to leads) because the whole crystal is locked.
So far, most experimental probes of moiré Wigner crystals have been static (e.g. compressibility measurements, optical sensing of charge order, STM images). But a few have started exploring transport in these states. For instance, in some moiré bilayer WSe$_2$ systems, insulating behavior at fractional fillings has been observed, and when an in-plane electric field is applied, the current remains exponentially small – consistent with strong pinning. It remains to be seen if at even lower $T$ a residual current appears. There is also an interesting possibility of designing a device to measure FR current-voltage characteristics of a moiré crystal (like a narrow channel or Corbino geometry in which a force can be applied to the electrons). If achieved, one could directly look for the phenomena predicted: reduced depinning fields for incommensurate phases, multi-step depinning, and asymmetric response above and below a commensurate filling (Reichhardt et al. noted that adding particles vs removing them from a commensurate state leads to interstitial vs vacancy dynamics, which are not symmetric and lead to different depinning behaviors).
An exciting aspect of moiré systems is the tunability of the pinning landscape. By electrical gating, one can adjust the periodic potential depth (e.g. by changing displacement fields in TMD heterobilayers) and thereby effectively tune how strong the moiré pinning is. One can also dial the density continuously. This means one could in principle induce a sliding phase at certain parameters – a kind of moiré supersolid transport – or tune into a regime of dissipationless sliding. Indeed, Reichhardt et al. speculate that “if experiments can realize sliding dynamics in moiré systems, it would open another class of commensurate and incommensurate phases for study”, including potentially useful *“antikink flow” transport modes that carry charge in a topologically robust way along domain lines. These unique sliding states (where only domain walls move while the lattice stays mostly pinned) could be exploited for charge transport along selectable pathways in a device, essentially using the moiré crystal as a reconfigurable charge conductor.
In conclusion, moiré and generalized Wigner crystals extend the paradigm of quantum pinning to designer lattices where both the pinning strength and the commensurability can be tuned in situ. We expect zero-temperature depinning to be a real possibility in incommensurate moiré crystals, manifesting as a finite conductance that cannot be frozen out. The interplay of quantum fluctuations, long-range Coulomb interactions, and periodic substrates in these systems is a rich field, linking concepts from CDW physics, Wigner solids, and even Frenkel-Kontorova models. As experiments reach deeper into the low-temperature, low-disorder regime of moiré materials, we anticipate the first observations of quantum creep and tunneling in an artificially engineered electron crystal.
4. Recent Advances (2020–2025) and Broader Implications
Research in the last few years has made significant strides in observing and understanding quantum pinning:
• Quantum Creep in Vortex Systems: Although the foundational work dates back decades, new materials and techniques keep the topic alive. For instance, in ultra-thin superconducting films near the superconductor-insulator transition, evidence suggests a “quantum vortex liquid” phase where quantum fluctuations of vortices prevent true zero resistance at $T=0$. A 2022 perspective highlighted how improving pinning in superconductors is critical for applications, but also how quantum tunneling imposes a fundamental limit on how still flux lines can be at low $T$. On the theoretical side, the connection between vortex quantum tunneling and the mysterious intermediate “quantum metallic state” in 2D superconductors is being explored. This has implications for quantum computing with superconducting circuits: stray vortices can tunnel and cause decoherence or noise in qubits. Designing qubit geometries to either trap vortices securely or eliminate them (e.g. via vortex pinning arrays) is informed by our understanding of quantum pinning.
• Macroscopic Quantum Tunneling in CDWs: Recent high-pressure studies and ultrafast experiments on CDW materials have reached regimes where thermal effects are minimal. In 2021, experiments on 2H-NbSe$_2$ under pressure indicated the presence of a quantum critical point associated with CDW order disappearance, suggesting that lattice pinning can be overcome by quantum fluctuations at zero temperature. On the applied side, there is growing interest in using collective tunneling of CDWs for novel computing architectures. In 2020, Miller et al. demonstrated a CDW oscillator network that can solve optimization problems, essentially harnessing the collective dynamics of the CDW. While that work was classical, it opens the question of whether the quantum aspects (e.g. tunneling between phase configurations) could be exploited to perform computations or simulations that benefit from quantum parallelism. The combination of high-$T$ CDWs (which operate near room T) and quantum coherence is speculative but tantalizing (e.g. could there be quantum coherent CDW transport at 77 K? Probably not in conventional materials, but new 2D materials might surprise us).
• 2D Electron Solids and Fractional Quantum Hall: The 2018–2023 period saw a renaissance in studying pinning modes and sliding transport in high-mobility 2DES. In 2018, a study reported transport evidence of a sliding electron solid – they observed a nonlinear $I$–$V$ that extrapolated to a finite conductance as $T\to0$, consistent with quantum depinning. In 2023, Shayegan and co-workers demonstrated moving Wigner crystal phases where the depinned electron solid could carry current without immediately dissolving into a fully disordered state. They even identified multiple moving phases (a moving crystal and a moving liquid) depending on drive. In 2024, Shashkin et al. reported collective depinning and sliding in a 2D electron system, reinforcing that even in strongly interacting electron solids, quantum effects allow for finite conductivity at zero temperature. These experimental advances were enabled by ultralow temperatures (millikelvin range), extremely clean samples, and sensitive electronics. The data help refine theories of 2D melting and pinning – for example, how quantum fluctuations might lead to two-stage melting (a first stage where the solid becomes a moving solid with residual order, and a second where it melts into a liquid, as suggested by simulations).
• Magnetic Skyrmions – Toward the Quantum Limit: In 2020, the first concrete theoretical framework for quantum skyrmion depinning was put forward. This has inspired experimentalists working on skyrmion-hosting materials to probe lower temperature regimes. One group has been trying to observe tunneling escape of single skyrmions in micron-sized magnetic traps – so far without success, but the effort has led to better control of individual skyrmions. On the theory side, proposals for skyrmion-based qubits have emerged: utilizing a skyrmion’s quantized helicity or positional quantization to encode a two-level system. The idea would be to use spintronic tools to prepare and measure the state, while the skyrmion is in a quantum-superposition of being, say, pinning-site A or B (or helicity clockwise vs counterclockwise). While still very far-fetched experimentally, it shows the fertile intersection of topological magnetism and quantum information. Another practical implication is for racetrack memory: skyrmion devices rely on pinning to store bits (a skyrmion should stay in a nanodot) but also require moving skyrmions with currents. If quantum tunneling causes spontaneous bit flips (skyrmion escaping), that could set a limit on how small/skyrmions or how low-$T$ one can operate such memory reliably. Knowing the tunneling rates predicted, device engineers can decide if a skyrmion is stable enough for the intended application or if material parameters need adjustment (e.g. increasing anisotropy to deepen the pinning potential).
• Moiré Superlattices and Designer Pinning: As discussed in §3.5, a 2025 study provided a roadmap for experimental discovery of sliding phases in moiré materials. Although experiments have not yet observed quantum depinning in moiré systems (partly because these systems often have stronger quantum fluctuations making it hard to tell solid from liquid, and partly because of technical challenges in measuring tiny currents through insulators), the community now has clear predictions. The broader implication is that moiré heterostructures could be used to simulate classic models of friction and pinning (Frenkel-Kontorova models, Josephson junction arrays, etc.) in a highly tunable way. This might unlock new regimes, such as probing how a 2D array of charge can exhibit superlubricity (frictionless motion) when incommensurate – a phenomenon relevant to nanotribology (e.g. friction between 2D materials might be extremely low if lattices are incommensurate). If one can electrically toggle between a commensurate pinned state and an incommensurate sliding state, one effectively has an electrically controlled friction switch – an exciting prospect for NEMS (nano-electromechanical systems).
• Quantum Pinning in Other Contexts: The ideas of quantum pinning extend to other systems as well. For example, in ultracold atomic gases, vortices in superfluid Bose–Einstein condensates can get pinned to optical lattice potentials, and at zero temperature their hopping between pin sites would be a purely quantum effect. Experiments in 2021 showed pinning of vortices in BECs by a laser array, and future work may look for quantum creep of vortices in that clean environment. Another arena is optical photon crystals: there are proposals for using light in nonlinear media to form lattice solitons, which could analogously pin and tunnel. While more exotic, it underscores that the physics of an object in a periodic/quenched potential is very general.
Broader Implications: Understanding quantum pinning phenomena has wide-ranging implications:
• In quantum materials, pinning often competes with novel electronic orders. Quantum fluctuations that enable depinning can stabilize or destabilize phases (e.g. a quantum melted Wigner crystal might give rise to an exotic non-Fermi liquid). Moreover, many quantum materials (high-$T_c$ superconductors, CDW compounds, moiré systems) have complex energy landscapes; knowing how quantum tunneling navigates these landscapes is key to understanding low-$T$ behavior (like zero-temperature “residual” resistivities and the absence or presence of true long-range order).
• For device engineering, especially in superconducting magnets and electronics: Flux pinning is crucial for applications like MRI magnets and lossless power lines. Quantum creep means that over long times, a superconducting magnet will slowly lose current (the “persistent current” isn’t truly persistent at $T=0$ but decays on extremely long time scales). This sets a fundamental limit to magnet stability. Engineers must either operate at temperatures where creep is negligible or design pinning centers such that the quantum tunneling action is maximized (for example, using materials with higher damping or more extended defect potentials to inhibit tunneling). In the context of superconducting qubits, as mentioned, stray vortices tunneling can produce 1/$f$ flux noise – a major source of decoherence. Thus, improved qubit designs include vortex trapping sites or use materials where vortices are strongly bound at preferred locations, reducing their quantum wanderings.
• In low-temperature transport physics, quantum pinning provides natural explanations for otherwise puzzling residual conductivities. For instance, the so-called “metallic behavior” in 2D insulators (like electrons in MOSFETs at low density) could be reinterpreted as a pinned electron solid that conducts via quantum tunneling (rather than a genuine metal). Some studies indeed have argued that what appears as a metal is a quantum Coulomb glass that never truly freezes. These interpretations can unify viewpoints between those who expect a metal-insulator transition in 2D and those who consider electron glass physics.
• Lastly, in designing tunable pinning landscapes – whether via nanostructuring (e.g. lithographically fabricated pinning arrays for vortices or skyrmions) or via moiré patterns – one must consider quantum effects at the design stage. For example, one might design a pinning array for vortices that creates a ratchet potential for quantum vortices, enabling diode-like behavior even at $T=0$ (quantum vortex ratchets). Similarly, by patterning an array of holes in a magnetic film, one can pin skyrmions in a desired arrangement; but if those skyrmions can tunnel between adjacent pinning sites, the device might fail to hold a stable pattern. On the flip side, one could use controlled tunneling as a feature: e.g. a skyrmion that quantum tunnels through a barrier could be used as a true random number generator or to perform quantum annealing for optimization problems, much like Josephson junctions are used in quantum annealers.
In conclusion, quantum pinning phenomena bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and disordered many-body systems. They remind us that even highly collective entities – vortex lattices, charge density waves, electron crystals, and skyrmions – obey quantum dynamics at the lowest temperatures. The years 2020–2025 have seen both experimental breakthroughs (catching glimpses of these effects in cleaner systems and novel materials) and theoretical developments (better models for tunneling rates and new proposed systems like moiré crystals). As materials science advances to create ever cleaner and more controlled systems, we expect to see even clearer manifestations of quantum depinning: perhaps a direct observation of a macroscopic tunneling event (e.g. a real-time detection of a flux quantum hopping, or a skyrmion appearing on the other side of a barrier without a thermal kick). Such observations would not only confirm decades-old predictions but also potentially herald new technologies that leverage these quantum events. The ongoing convergence of strong correlations, disorder, and quantum coherence will undoubtedly keep the study of quantum pinning at the forefront of condensed matter physics in the years to come.
