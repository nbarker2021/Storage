## PROOFING INFRASTRUCTURE OVERVIEW

This documentation provides comprehensive guidance for validating, testing, and developing formal proofs from AI-generated mathematical discoveries. The infrastructure supports the complete pipeline from computational evidence to formal mathematical proof.

### VALIDATION PIPELINE STAGES

1. **Initial Screening**: Basic mathematical consistency verification
2. **Computational Evidence Gathering**: Statistical validation and numerical testing
3. **Cross-Validation**: Independent verification across multiple scenarios
4. **Expert Review Integration**: Mathematical specialist evaluation
5. **Formal Proof Development**: Transition from computational evidence to rigorous proof

### KEY VALIDATION METRICS

- **Mathematical Validity Score** (0.0-1.0): Consistency with established mathematics
- **Computational Evidence Score** (0.0-1.0): Numerical support strength
- **Statistical Significance Score** (0.0-1.0): Evidence above random baselines
- **Reproducibility Score** (0.0-1.0): Independent verification consistency
- **Overall Validation Score**: Weighted combination of all metrics

### EVIDENCE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM

- **STRONG_EVIDENCE** (≥0.8): Ready for formal proof development
- **MODERATE_EVIDENCE** (≥0.6): Requires additional investigation
- **WEAK_EVIDENCE** (≥0.4): Preliminary support, needs strengthening
- **INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE** (<0.4): Requires fundamental revision

## FORMAL PROOF DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK

### Stage 1: Evidence Analysis and Lemma Extraction

**Computational Evidence → Mathematical Statements**
- Statistical correlations become existence theorems
- Geometric patterns become structural lemmas
- Numerical bounds become inequality statements
- Algorithmic procedures become constructive proofs

**Example Transformation**:
```
Computational Evidence: "P and NP problems occupy geometrically separated E8 chambers with δ=1.0"
Mathematical Statement: "∃δ>0 such that Hausdorff_distance(∪C_P, ∪C_NP) ≥ δ"
```

### Stage 2: Proof Strategy Development

**Geometric Proof Strategies**:
- E8 constraint analysis leading to impossibility arguments
- Geometric separation theorems via exceptional group properties
- Universal pattern theorems from cross-problem analysis

**Analytical Proof Strategies**:
- Correspondence theorems linking different mathematical structures
- Convergence arguments from computational iteration
- Existence proofs from constructive algorithms

### Stage 3: Formal Verification Integration

**Theorem Prover Integration**:
- Lean theorem prover specifications
- Coq proof assistant formalization
- Automated proof checking protocols

**Verification Standards**:
- Complete formal specification of all claims
- Machine-checkable proof construction
- Independent verification protocols

    return statistical_validation_score
```

### Protocol 3: Reproducibility Verification

**Reproducibility Requirements**:
- Deterministic algorithm specifications
- Complete parameter documentation

    # Run algorithm with fixed seeds
    # Test across different platforms
    # Verify parameter consistency
    # Check independent implementations
    return reproducibility_score
```
