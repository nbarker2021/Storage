Foundational Progression (n=0 to n=4)

The system begins in the void state (n=0), representing the interstitial space between identical digits, and progresses through carefully defined dimensional transitions that build complexity while maintaining mathematical rigor. The n=1 state materializes as a physical medium with a core datum interfaced with 8 dimensions of freedom, establishing the fundamental structure that underlies all subsequent operations.

The progression from n=1 through n=4 follows the enhanced foundational schema that provides rigorous algebraic, combinatorial, and structural grounding.
