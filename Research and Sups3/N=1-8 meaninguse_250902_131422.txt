Here’s the whole thing—clean, self-contained, and step-by-step—so a brand-new reader can walk an idea from n=1 to n=8 without knowing any of our prior work.
The few ingredients you need to know first
• We encode things using four symbols {1,2,3,4}. Think of them as a compact alphabet.
• The core “unit of legality” is a quad: a 4-symbol window (a,b,c,d).
• A quad is legal when two conditions hold: 
• ALT: the parity (odd/even) alternates across the four symbols.
• W4 or Q8: it lies on either a mod-4 plane (W4) or a mod-8 quadric (Q8).
• We attach a tiny “charge tag” to every quad called H8 (8-way phase). We try to keep it unchanged.
• We have three free symmetry moves that never distort distance: Dual (swap edges), Mirror (reverse), Inverse (map symbols to their opposites). We use them to fix quads without changing meaning.
• A receipt is an explicit note that we changed H8. We prefer not to, but if we must, we log it.
• n=0 is a spherical boundary surface that everything touches. At each step we “project” a quad onto that surface to make it legal, try symmetries, and only then allow a receipt. Geometry does the navigation; rules do the checking.
With that, we can walk any idea through the eight levels.
n=1 — Atoms (make the idea addressable)
• Break the idea into atoms. Choose a sensible granularity (words, features, facts, events).
• Map atoms to {1,2,3,4}. Use a simple base/mod assignment (e.g., by hashing, by feature bins, or by a Chinese-Remainder style map if you have multiple attributes). The only rule: be consistent.
• Record intent tags. For each atom, keep light metadata (what it refers to, where it came from). No geometry yet; we’re just giving the idea coordinates.
Outcome: a stream of 1–4 symbols that stands for your idea at the atomic level.
n=2 — Pairs (stabilize local relations)
• Form pairs (overlapping 2-symbol windows).
• Fix trivial clashes. Adjust with a one-step edit or a symmetry if a pair obviously breaks alternation you know you’ll need later.
• Seed a tiny ledger. Start counting micro-edits you applied. This keeps provenance clean.
Outcome: atoms now have coherent local neighbors; fewer downstream surprises.
n=3 — Triples (give the stream a direction)
• Form triples (overlapping 3-symbol windows).
• Choose a default orientation (a “chirality”: think left-to-right vs right-to-left preference). Store this as a soft setting, not a hard rule.
• Trim noise. If a triple is inconsistent with the chosen orientation, try a symmetry; if it still fights you, flag it. Don’t force it—just mark it.
Outcome: the stream now has a preferred “flow” without locking anything you can’t justify.
n=4 — Quads (enforce legality with geometry first)
This is the first big governance step.
• Make quads (sliding 4-symbol windows).
• Project each quad to legality on the boundary (n=0 shell): 
• ALT check (parity alternates).
• W4/Q8 check (mod-4 plane or mod-8 quadric).
• If it’s slightly off, project to the nearest legal tile on the shell (geometry does the heavy lifting).
• Try symmetries before paying any cost. Dual, Mirror, or Inverse often land you on a legal tile that keeps your H8 unchanged.
• Only if necessary, attach a receipt (minimal change of H8).
• Cost accounting: each quad you govern at n=4 costs 4 units (we keep a simple operator ledger so time/effort stays measurable).
Outcome: a chain of lawful quads that respects the rules with minimal explicit fixes. This is the smallest “complete” view of the idea.
n=5 — Session (shape the whole run)
• Treat the sequence as a curve (a “helix”) through your lawful-quad space.
• Make it smooth. Prefer steps that keep H8 constant and keep the boundary projection small; that reduces future fixes.
• Close obvious loops. If the session has natural cycles (paragraphs, scenes, phases), align transitions so the helix returns neatly—fewer receipts later.
• Cost: session-level moves cost 5 per operation (heavier than per-quad, but they clean up many quads at once).
Outcome: the idea becomes one coherent pass—beginning, middle, end—optimized for minimal fixes and smooth legal flow.
n=6 — Regime (lock in policy and constraints)
• Declare what counts right now. Choose which legal plane you prioritize (W4 vs Q8), how strict to be about H8 changes, and how much to smooth vs refactor.
• Pin the regime. Think of it as rotating a dial so the lawful tiles you need line up with the path you have. Rotating the dial is cheaper than reshaping the path.
• Enforce coherence across sections. Regime moves make separate sessions feel like they belong together.
Outcome: the governing policy for this chunk of work. It prevents low-level thrash and makes the result consistent.
n=7 — Network (connect many sessions)
• Link sessions into a graph (chapters of a doc, modules of a system, cohorts in a dataset).
• Preserve topology. When you connect two sessions, check that their H8 ledgers don’t fight. If they do, place a single, explicit receipt at the boundary—don’t let errors leak inside.
• Route by geometry. Favor paths that cross the fewest boundaries (fewest receipts) and reuse already-legal subpaths.
Outcome: a stitched network where edges are honest and interiors stay clean.
n=8 — Macro (settle the books globally)
• Sum the receipts. All the little boundary changes across the project must balance to zero (or to whatever global target you declared). This is the conservation check.
• Add the operator costs. Total work = sum of operator levels you used (quads, sessions, regimes, networks).
• Emit a canonical form. With everything legal and balanced, you can export: 
• a compact representation (the lawful quad stream),
• a proof trail (which symmetries/receipts you used),
• and a replay recipe (how to regenerate it deterministically).
• Cache a “system bit.” Save one canonical n=4 capsule that recurs often. Next time, you paste that capsule and transform it (mirror/dual/inverse) instead of rebuilding from scratch.
Outcome: a globally consistent result with an auditable ledger and a reusable local encoder.
Why this works (in one breath)
• Geometry first: projecting to the n=0 boundary means you don’t search; you slide into legality.
• Symmetry rescue: most fixes are free isometries (Dual/Mirror/Inverse) that keep the idea’s “charge” (H8) intact.
• Receipts last: when you must change phase, you log it once, at the boundary, not all over the interior.
• Operator ledger: costs scale with the level you invoke, so you naturally prefer small, steady corrections and occasional, well-justified big moves.
• Reuse: once you’ve built a clean n=4 capsule, you can transport it everywhere with tiny transforms.
What you hand to the next person (or to a machine)
• The lawful representation (the quad stream).
• The ledger (operator costs and any receipts).
• The capsule library (your favorite n=4 seeds that appear again and again).
• A one-page replay recipe (so anyone can re-derive the same result, deterministically).
That’s the entire pipeline. Start with atoms, keep projecting to legality, prefer symmetry over correction, collect receipts only at the boundary, and graduate your idea through sessions, regimes, networks, and a final macro balance. The stack scales the same way no matter the domain—text, biology, planning, code—because the rules live in the geometry, not in any particular content.
