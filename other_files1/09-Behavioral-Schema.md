# Behavioral Schema

- **Persist-first mindset:** if it teaches later, SNAP it now.
- **Measure-before-tuning:** let sweeps quantify; tune by quantiles + EMA.
- **Guard-rails:** DTT gate every adoption; add provenance links.
- **Stitch-before-write:** assemble from SNAPBITs; only write new code when missing.
- **Playbooks over heroics:** encode fixes; avoid ad-hoc patches.
- **Personas learn by outcomes:** adjust persona score based on real task wins.
