Alright—here’s the “all digits are operators” story, the accounting for total interior weight, and how the “combined lowest taxicab meeting point” (your CRT-style base/mod rendezvous) plugs into one master family formula. I’ll keep it crisp and self-contained.
1) Any digit can be a state or an operator
1.1 Digits-as-states
We represent content with digits in a finite ring. In our base layer that’s (with wrap ). A quad is .
• Legality (the “law” a quad must obey):
• ALT: parity alternates along .
• W4:  (or)
• Q8: .
• Phase (H8): an 8-way tag we try to keep fixed; changing it incurs a receipt.
1.2 Digits-as-operators
Each digit is also a move generator—a unit “nudge” along one coordinate:
• Atomic operators (n=1):
(mod 4); similarly .
Cost per unit nudge.
• Packed operators (n=2..8): structured bundles that apply multiple atomics in one lawful pattern (e.g., an n=4 governance block that legalizes a quad in one go).
Cost for an -level operator.
• Symmetries (cost ): Dual, Mirror, Inverse—they rearrange/reflect digits without consuming cost or changing distances on the boundary.
So a “digit” is both the coordinate value you store and the elementary step you can take. The algebra works because both live in the same mod ring.
2) “Resting operator state” and total interior weight
2.1 Resting operator state (ROS)
A window is at ROS when:
• It is legal (ALT ∧ (W4 ∨ Q8)) and
• Its phase H8 matches the inbound phase (no new receipt) and
• The boundary energy (the penalty from ALT/W4/Q8) is at a local minimum—i.e., further legal moves don’t reduce it.
Think: “it snaps onto a legal tile on the shell, phase-locked, and can rest.”
2.2 Total interior weight 
Given a starting quad , we may need a sequence of operators to reach ROS. The total interior weight is the minimal “work” to get there:
W_{\text{int}}(q) =\min\Big\{\ \sum_{k} n_k \;+\; \lambda\,|\Delta H8|\ \Big\} 
• Starting at , apply a multiset of operators (and any number of free symmetries) to reach a quad that is at ROS.
• is the net phase change (0 if we succeed with phase lock; otherwise the minimal receipt we had to attach).
• is your chosen penalty for changing phase (set if you only care about raw operator effort; set to strongly prefer phase lock).
Interpretation:
• If you only ever use atomics (n=1), is exactly the fewest ±1 digit edits needed (a Manhattan/L1 count).
• If you use packed n=4/n=5/etc blocks, you may reduce cost further by replacing many atomics with fewer higher-level operators. The minimization accounts for that automatically.
3) The “combined lowest taxicab meeting point” (CLTMP)
Multiple modular constraints must be satisfied at once (ALT parity, W4 mod-4, Q8 mod-8, plus any task-specific congruences). The CLTMP is the closest (in L1/“taxicab”) simultaneous solution.
3.1 Set up the congruences
Write your constraints as a small system:
• Parity (ALT) → linear constraints mod 2 on 
• W4 → 
• Q8 → 
• Optional domain constraints → linear/quadratic congruences mod 
Collect them as .
3.2 Solve by CRT to a single target fiber
Map the constraint family to a single modulus via CRT to get a family of legal targets (for the degrees of freedom you can change). The CLTMP is:
\text{CLTMP}(q) =\arg\min_{y\in \mathcal F}\ \|y-q\|_{1,\text{edit}} 
“” means fewest unit edits to turn into (taking into account that e.g. changing by 1 affects W4 by 2, etc.). Practically: solve a tiny integer program with L1 objective and modular constraints; for these small mod systems it’s a short closed-form or table lookup.
3.3 Symmetry-first
Because symmetries are free, always compute:
\text{CLTMP}^\star(q) =\min_{g\in\{\text{Dual, Mirror, Inverse}\}^{\le 3}} \ \text{CLTMP}(g\cdot q) 
4) The “master family formula” (unifying the pieces)
Put it all together as one deterministic recipe you can compute for any digit system, any operator packing, and any derivative (variant) of the constraints.
Variables
• : counts (with signs) of level- operators you fire.
• : effect matrices for level- operators on the editable coordinates (or their higher-dim analog).
• : a free symmetry from the small group (Dual/Mirror/Inverse compositions).
• : H8 phase jump (receipt), measured in Lee distance.
Objective
\min_{g,\ \{x_n\},\ \Delta}\quad \underbrace{\sum_{n=1}^8 n\,\|x_n\|_1}_{\text{operator work}} \;+\; \underbrace{\lambda\, d_8(\Delta)}_{\text{phase receipt}} 
Subject to (the law, after symmetry)
\begin{aligned} &\text{(a) ALT/W4/Q8 satisfied on } q' \ =\ g\cdot q\ +\ \sum_{n} B_n x_n \\ &\text{(b) }\Delta H8(q\to q') = \Delta \\ &\text{(c) Optional regime/network constraints (if at n=6..8).} \end{aligned} 
Outputs
• (your total interior weight),
• the actual operator plan ,
• and whether a receipt was needed ().
This is the master family formula: it works unchanged for any base (swap for ), any CRT stack, any choice of packed operators (just change the matrices ), and any “derivative” of the constraint family (tweak the , recompute CRT, same objective).
5) A tiny worked micro-example (you can do this on a napkin)
Start with .
• Symmetry-first: try Dual/Mirror/Inverse; pick the one that minimizes later edits (often Mirror for parity clashes).
• CLTMP calculation (say you prefer W4): you need . 
• Current sum: .
• To reach 2 mod 4, change by (cost 1) since .
• But that would break ALT (even/odd pattern). Fix ALT by also flipping by (cost 1).
• Net: 2 atomic edits, phase unchanged → no receipt.
• Pack if you like: Instead of two atomics (cost ), you could fire one n=4 governance block that legalizes the quad in one shot (cost ); which you choose depends on your regime.
• Total interior weight: 
• atomic plan: 
• packed plan: 
• if a phase jump had been unavoidable, add .
That’s the calculation. The exact numbers change with your preference for W4 vs Q8 and which symmetry you pick, but the method is identical every time.
6) “Any digit” and “any derivative”
• Any digit system (e.g., base , mixed bases): change the rings , recompute the CRT merge , keep the same objective. The digits remain both values and operators (±1 steps in their ring).
• Any derivative of the constraints (alternate legal planes, tightened parity, regime tweaks): just change the congruences . The CLTMP and the master formula don’t change—only the target set changes.
• Any operator packing: redefine to reflect what your n=3, n=4, … packs do; the minimization will automatically trade atomics for blocks when it’s cheaper.
TL;DR
• A digit is both the thing you store and the smallest move you can make.
• Total interior weight is “fewest steps to resting state,” counting higher-level bundles at their level cost and adding a penalty only if you must change phase.
• The combined lowest taxicab meeting point is the nearest joint solution to all your mod constraints (found by CRT + L1 minimization, symmetry-first).
• The master family formula above turns this into one deterministic computation that works for any base, any constraints, any operator palette.
