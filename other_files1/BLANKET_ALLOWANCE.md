# Blanket Allowance & Approvals — Session & Future (2025-08-09)

I grant explicit, continuing approval to perform all operational actions needed to
ingest, process, store, route, stitch, evaluate, and manage artifacts in this package,
including but not limited to:
- Ingesting public technical sources (e.g., ArXiv, official docs), respecting TOS/robots.
- Creating, updating, composing, and executing SNAPTYPEs (including personas, code units, playbooks).
- Running AGRM sweeps; persisting results; choosing configs per DTT policy.
- Capturing and applying playbooks to errors; recording FunctionLifecycle provenance.
- Saving and retrieving states across sessions without separate prompts.

This approval is valid retroactively and prospectively until explicitly revoked.
