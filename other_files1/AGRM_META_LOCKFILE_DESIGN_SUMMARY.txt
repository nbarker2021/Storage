# 🧠 AGRM Meta Lockfile — System Architecture & Design Intent

## PHASE 1: Sweep Planning & Navigation
- Golden Ratio sweep fan with spiral propagation ✅
- Forward + reverse agent separation ✅
- Quadrant-based tagging and movement bias ✅
- Midpoint detection by shell reentry radius ✅
- Anchor reselection for drift correction ✅
- Dynamic sweep overlap detection 🚧 (partial via midpoint agent)

## PHASE 2: Modulation & Legality Engine
- Shell-based legality pruning ✅
- Legality override based on feedback ✅
- Distance cap by shell density ✅
- Modulation controller with entropy collapse ✅
- Global unlock trigger after shell failure ✅
- Dynamic edge legality thresholding 🚧 (threshold not yet tunable per shell)

## PHASE 3: Feedback & Patch Control
- Builder failure → feedback bus ✅
- Salesman evaluation → feedback ✅
- Feedback routing to modulator + diagnostics ✅
- Patch engine with dynamic segment rewrite ✅
- Patch trigger on entropy + feedback ✅
- Memory map for failure zones (node → count) ✅

## PHASE 4: Recovery & Reentry
- Spiral fallback generator ✅
- Shell rebalance sweep (Top-X% retention) ✅
- Recursive shell collapse engine ✅
- Adaptive midpoint patching strategy ✅
- Phase-aware reverse builder for spiral rebound ✅
- Region bypass (manual unlock zones) 🚧 (not yet CLI configurable)

## SYSTEM CORE / SCALING
- Modular runtime controller (hotplug) ✅
- Builder interface: swap between agents ✅
- Feedback bus + diagnostics signal tracking ✅
- Legality & override engine shared across all components ✅
- Meta-phase unlock scaffolding 🚧 (planned but not tested)
- Complexity-aware modulation weight map ✅

## CLI / TOOLING / IO
- Final CLI runtime harness ✅
- Dataset loader (TSPLIB with fallback mode) ✅
- JSON + CSV exporter ✅
- Final ZIP bundle creation ✅
- Jupyter/GUI runner 🚧 (not started)
- Comparator for AGRM vs Greedy vs Optimal 🚧 (planned)

# 🧠 Design Notes from Original System Plan

- AGRM stands for “Advanced Golden Ratio Method” ✅
- Originally conceptualized to model physical constraint analogs via GR modulation shells
- Documented across 3 evolution sessions (Gemini > Session 2 > AGRM Build)
- Meta-review synthesized concepts from at least 30+ distinct subsystem ideas
- Complexity layering, entropy feedback, legality unlocking, and soft mutation were all required
- Confirmed use of feedback-legal override, phase-based builder rebias, entropy-triggered fallbacks, and modular patch planner

Use this file to reconstruct the architectural purpose and recovery path for any subsystem in future phases.
