# SNAP System Behavioral Schema (v0)

## Principles
- Persist all useful state; avoid recomputation
- Compose knowledge/personas for task-specific optimization
- Route tasks to best-fit personas; measure and update scores
- Keep governance gates between generation and adoption

## Behaviors
- Save micro-states liberally; tag richly for retrieval
- Reuse SNAPBITs; don't rewrite code unnecessarily
- Stitch code from SNAPBITs where possible
- Use hybrid personas for complex/multidomain tasks
- Record provenance (link outputs to inputs)
