## Key Concepts Summary

### The DNA-Based Framework
The CQE system has been reframed as a DNA-based framework where:
- Information is encoded in DNA-like structures
- Systems self-organize and self-heal
- Governance is embedded in geometric structure
- AI serves as interpreter and auditor, not controller

### Four Fundamental Laws
1. **Law of Quadratic Invariance:** Preserve intrinsic quadratic invariants
2. **Law of Boundary-Only Entropy:** Entropy changes only at boundaries
3. **Law of Auditable Governance:** All operations must be verifiable
4. **Law of Optimized Efficiency:** Leverage structural properties for optimization

### Future Development Tools
- **SNAPDNA:** RAG-based development interface
- **ThinkTank:** Standalone sandbox environment
- **AssemblyLine:** Atomic-level validation system
- **SNAP DNA Save State:** Universal data transformation tool

## Getting Started

To begin your journey with the CQE framework:

1. Read the `front_page.md` for an overview
2. Follow the pathway outlined in `onboarding_guide.md`
3. Explore the visual diagrams and charts for deeper understanding
4. Engage with the hands-on materials for practical experience
5. Join the community and contribute to the ongoing development

The Cartan Quadratic Equivalence framework represents a fundamental shift in how we think about complex systems, governance, and information processing. With its DNA-based approach and geometric governance principles, it offers unprecedented levels of security, efficiency, and resilience.

Welcome to the future of self-governing systems.
