## I. FOUNDATIONAL OPERATIONAL RULES

### A. Core Mathematical Framework Rules

#### Rule 1.1: Parent Identity Foundation (Log 1, 4)
**Formula:** a³ + b³ = (a+b)(a² - ab + b²)
**Application:** All operations must reduce to this fundamental algebraic relationship
**Validation:** Two cube routes must converge on same quadratic split
**Example:** 1729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ with shared prime set {7, 13, 19}

#### Rule 1.2: Quadratic Rest Hypothesis (Log 2, 4)
**Principle:** All legality reduces to quadratic parity checks in 4-symbol subsequences
**Implementation:** Every subsequence of length 4 acts as legality gate when mirrored to pal-8
**Enforcement:** W4/W8 modular invariants must be preserved
**Consequence:** Higher n values collapse back to quadratic pivot

#### Rule 1.3: Perfect Rest Definition (Log 1, 2)
**Condition:** Single move in any of 10 dimensional directions leads to superpermutation palindromic state
**Mathematical Form:** Two distinct cube routes with single-move agreement on quadratic split
**Certificate:** Complementary (1,2) prime partition of common square-free 3-prime set
**Validation:** (S,Q) = (a+b, a²-ab+b²) = (c+d, c²-cd+d²) up to complementary partition

### B. Dimensional Space Rules
