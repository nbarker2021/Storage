# Lattice Builder & Validator v1 (pure stdlib)

**What it does**
- Build ADE root-lattice Gram matrices from specs like `E8^3`, `A8 + D16`, `A1^24`.
- Validate integrality, evenness, determinant & unimodularity.
- Enumerate short vectors (Fincke–Pohst style) to detect roots (norm 2) and minimal norms.
- Check 24D even–unimodular candidates and distinguish **Leech** vs. **(rooted) Niemeier** by root presence.

**Why this is sound (mathematically)**
- Root lattices have Gram = Cartan matrix (diag 2, -1 along Dynkin edges). Evenness ⇒ diagonal entries even, and the lattice generated by simple roots has roots precisely at squared-length 2.
- In 24D, **Niemeier’s classification** says there are 23 even unimodular lattices with roots (labeled by their Dynkin diagrams) and exactly **one rootless**: the **Leech lattice**. So: even + unimodular + rank 24 + rootless ⇒ Leech.

**Use**
```bash
# 1) Build a Gram matrix for E8^3 and save as JSON
python lattice_builder_v1.py build "E8^3" --out e8x3_gram.json

# 2) Validate lattice properties
python lattice_builder_v1.py validate --gram-json e8x3_gram.json

# 3) Enumerate short vectors to find roots of norm 2
python lattice_builder_v1.py roots --gram-json e8x3_gram.json --bound 2.0

# 4) Niemeier check (24D)
python lattice_builder_v1.py build "A1^24" --out a1x24.json
python lattice_builder_v1.py validate --gram-json a1x24.json
python lattice_builder_v1.py niemeier --gram-json a1x24.json
```

**Notes**
- Enumeration is exponential; good for confirming root presence (norm 2) and small bounds. Don’t expect full vector listings in 24D.
- This module does *not* construct overlattices via glue codes. It’s a validator for the base root lattices and for the Leech/“rootless” test on 24D even–unimodular candidates.
- You can feed any symmetric positive-definite Gram in JSON to `validate` and `roots`.

**Integrations**
- Sidecar: wrap invocations in your receipts engine; store hashes of the Gram JSON and the property report.
- Geometry stack: export your geometry-native prototypes to ADE specs or to explicit Grams and run this checker as a guardrail.
