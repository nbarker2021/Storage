# CQE-SnapLat Slice

## Purpose and Scope

The CQE-SnapLat slice integrates the concepts of SnapLat, Shelling, and Glyphs from the phone data into the CQE Operating System. It provides a robust framework for indexing, relating, and compressing data within the E8 geometric substrate. This slice is responsible for the creation of "snaps" (atomic units of information), the "shelling" process of analyzing and refining them, and their eventual compression into "glyphs" (symbolic representations).

## Core Concepts

*   **Snaps:** Atomic units of information, analogous to CQE Atoms, that are embedded in the E8 lattice.
*   **Shelling:** A multi-stage process of analyzing, refining, and validating snaps. This process involves a series of "n-levels" that progressively increase in complexity and abstraction.
*   **Glyphs:** Compressed, symbolic representations of snaps that have successfully passed through the shelling process. Glyphs serve as a form of "semantic shorthand" that can be efficiently stored and retrieved.

## Integration with CQE OS

The CQE-SnapLat slice is tightly integrated with the following CQE OS components:

| CQE Component      | Integration Point                                                                                                                            |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CQE Kernel**     | The SnapLat slice relies on the CQE Kernel for all E8 lattice operations, including the embedding of snaps and the computation of geometric relationships. |
| **Storage Manager**| The Storage Manager is used to persist snaps, glyphs, and their associated metadata.                                                          |
| **Reasoning Engine**| The shelling process is orchestrated by the Reasoning Engine, which uses the n-levels to guide the analysis and validation of snaps.              |
| **Language Engine**| The Language Engine is used to translate between human language and the symbolic representation of glyphs.                                       |
