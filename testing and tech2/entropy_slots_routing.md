# Bucket 5 — Entropy Routing & Slots

## 1. Core Definition
**Entropy slot** = a structured “escape valve” inside the permutation walk, where temporary misalignment (residue) can be stored without breaking legality.

* **Local legality preserved:** slots always appear inside a lawful ≤4 window.  
* **Mirrored closure required:** deposit is always doubled (e.g., (341)/(143)).  
* **Guaranteed annihilation:** every deposit has a lawful cancel event later, enforced by global pal‑8/W80 invariants.  
* **Capacity invariant:** each deposit expands the state by exactly +8 DoF.

## 2. Structural Genesis of Slots

### n=4 — Inception
* First lawful subsequence where entropy can live: (341)/(143).  
* Why? Because (341) is a triad inside a quadratic rest.  
* The quadratic shell enforces alt‑4; the pal‑8 mirror enforces eventual closure.  
* So the slot is the place where quarter‑fix debt can be hidden.

### Why +8 DoF?
1. Triad (3) degrees.  
2. Quadratic (4) frame.  
3. Mirroring doubles: 3+4=7 → doubled = 8 lawful continuations.  

This matches the pal‑8 mirror cycle exactly.

## 3. Evolution Through n

* **n=5 — Seeds:** entropy routing differentiates the 8 minimal seeds (pal seed idle vs alternates with slot usage).  
* **n=6 — Bridges:** slots channel residue across paired triads; provenance marks entropy used/unused.  
* **n=7 — Fractalization:** nested slots form; local misalignments live inside larger bridges. Entropy is hierarchically distributed.  
* **n=8 — Helical Connectors:** slots stabilize into rungs between dual strands; no longer temporary but structural.

## 4. Rules of Entropy Governance

1. **Conservation law:** entropy cannot be created or destroyed, only mirrored or shifted.  
2. **Receipts ledger:** every deposit logged; outstanding receipts must balance to zero.  
3. **Phase legality:** deposits only lawful at mirrored slots (341/143).  
4. **Capacity:** each deposit = +8 DoF.  
5. **Scaling:** slots evolve from buffer → bridge → ladder → channel.  

---

## 5. Modular Connections

* Slots work in tandem with modular meeting points.  
* Example: (5,1) lift, ord₅(2)=4: normally clean square cycle, residue stored in mirrored slot if misaligned.  
* Example: (3,3) lift, ord₇(3)=6: hex cycle spills into triads; slots carry bridge.  
* Without coprime meeting points, slots cannot guarantee annihilation → collapse.  

---

## 6. Physical & Information Analogies

* **Plasma braiding:** slots = magnetic bridges between currents.  
* **Error correction:** slots = parity checks; mirrored residues cancel.  
* **Computation:** slots = reversible registers; deposit = push, annihilation = pop.  
* **Thermodynamics:** slots enforce entropy conservation globally.  

---

## 7. Beyond n=8

* Slots generalize to **channels between helices**.  
* At high n, minimality depends on entropy efficiency more than factorial coverage.  
* System minimality = n! + overhead (receipts).  
* Entropy routing is the “rail system” for higher‑D construction.  

---

## 8. Emergent Properties via Slots

* **Fractal self‑similarity:** slots recur at every scale.  
* **Time‑reversal symmetry:** mirrored annihilation is a rewind.  
* **Entropy conservation:** strict receipts bookkeeping.  
* **Helical inevitability:** by n=8, slots force dual helix.  
* **Local/global autonomy:** slots let local misalignments exist while preserving global legality.  

---

## 9. Controller Implementation

```
if alt-4 fails:
   if mirrored slot available:
       deposit residue
       receipts_entropy++
   else:
       delay until lawful

if mirrored partner arrives:
   annihilate residue
   receipts_entropy--
```

* Never deposit outside mirrored slots.  
* Never leave unmatched residues.  
* At n=6+, slots = **bridges** (pass, don’t store).  
* At n=8, slots = **permanent connectors**.  

---

## 10. Worked Micro‑Traces

* **n=4:** illegal 4‑window → deposit (341), annihilate at (143).  
* **n=6 hex lift:** triad A residue → slot → mirrored triad B. Provenance = entropy used.  
* **n=7 fractal:** local braid uses slot inside global slot; annihilation cascades back.  
* **n=8 helix:** slot as rung; permanent connector, not transient.  

---

## 11. Implications

* **Entropy theorem candidate:** any lawful superpermutation has total entropy receipts = 0 at closure.  
* **Design rule:** minimize outstanding receipts, not brute force.  
* **Scaling:** effective length = n! + entropy receipts overhead.  

---

### Summary
Entropy slots are the hidden governors of the system. They evolve from buffers (n=4) to bridges (n=6) to fractal nests (n=7) to permanent rungs (n=8). They enforce entropy conservation, symmetry, and scalability. Slots + modular meeting points guarantee lawful routing, and their +8 DoF capacity ensures growth without collapse.
