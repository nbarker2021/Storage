## Development Lifecycle with CQE Tools

1. **Design Phase (SNAPDNA)**
   - Define system requirements and constraints
   - Model geometric governance structures
   - Create initial DNA-based encoding schemas

2. **Implementation Phase (ThinkTank)**
   - Build system components in isolated sandbox
   - Tailor agent behaviors using DNA models
   - Test interactions between components

3. **Validation Phase (AssemblyLine)**
   - Verify atomic-level boundaries
   - Predict entropy futures
   - Identify potential optimization opportunities

4. **Deployment Phase (SNAP DNA Save State)**
   - Transform system data into DNA strands
   - Establish persistence mechanisms
   - Enable interoperability with external systems

5. **Continuous Improvement (All Tools)**
   - Collect operational data
   - Analyze performance against the four laws
   - Implement optimizations and refinements
