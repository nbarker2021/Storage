## 3. Data Analysis and Results

This section presents the quantitative and qualitative results of our linguistic validation tests. The data is drawn from the `linguistic_validation_report.json` file, which contains the output of our specialized testing harness.

### 3.1. Compression Validation

The compression validation test demonstrates that language tokens act as highly efficient compressors of semantic information. The average compression ratio across all tested languages was **16.90x**, with a maximum of **58.00x**. This provides strong evidence for the CQE principle of information compression.

| Language | Average Compression Ratio |
|---|---|
| English | 8.43x |
| Spanish | 8.06x |
| Portuguese | 7.43x |
| Japanese | 35.00x |
| Universal | 38.00x |

### 3.2. Contextual Dependency

The contextual dependency test achieved a **100% accuracy** in disambiguating the meaning of ambiguous tokens based on their context. This validates the CQE principle that meaning is not inherent in a token, but is a function of its relationship to its surrounding context.


### 3.3. Geometric Embedding

The geometric embedding test demonstrated that semantic relationships can be represented geometrically. The test achieved a **100% uniqueness ratio** for geometric signatures, indicating that each semantic token can be assigned a unique mathematical identity.


### 3.4. Universal and Language-Specific Patterns

Our analysis identified **1 universal linguistic principle(s)** that appear across all tested languages. We also identified **1 language-specific pattern(s)**, demonstrating that while universal principles exist, languages also exhibit unique patterns that reflect cultural and structural differences.


### 3.5. Hierarchical Scaling

The hierarchical scaling test demonstrated that language exhibits a clear hierarchical structure, from tokens to phrases to sentences. The test showed an average information preservation of **75%** across levels, validating the CQE principle of hierarchical organization.
