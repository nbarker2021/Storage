# CQE FULL UNIFIED MAX — Governance Rulebook (Snapshot)

- **Pose is an actuator**. CQE_CONTROLLER chooses θ* to minimize slice energy and enforces scale agreement.
- **Enforce without demand**. ARC360/PRIME/TRANSLATE record lawful snaps and bridges; mutations are proposals with receipts.
- **Multi-resolution monotonicity**. SLICE_CALCULUS verifies W=80→120→240→600 consistency; divergences flagged.
- **Bridges & tunneling** are admissible evidence, not mutations: seam-wrap, residue corridors, prime tunnels, cascade rings.
- **Promotion gates** (decision=any): A strict arc+bridge; B prime strength+CRT; C controller collapse+scale agreement;
  D loose arc + residue/prime bridge; E translate ΔΦ monotone+pack-compat; F ops integrity (CSV/JSON).
- **CI**: GOLDEN/REFUSAL must match exactly; FUZZER injects illegal moves at 1% and only reject/escrow is legal.
- **Proof receipts**: All controller/harness steps write hashed receipts to `proofs/`.
