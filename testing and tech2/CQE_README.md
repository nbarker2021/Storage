# CQE System — Readme & Quickstart (v1.0)

**Updated:** 2025-09-20

## What is CQE?

A rigorous, domain‑agnostic loop that stabilizes reasoning and execution into reproducible **receipts**.
It enforces coverage (8 views), symmetry (mirror), local repairs (Δ‑lifts), monotone tightening (strict), and
portable commits (4‑bit codes + hashes). Geometry is the governance; semantics are provisional until proven.

## The Spine (7 Gates)

1. **G0 Tokens** — Stand‑ins with units/guards; no semantics bound yet.
2. **G1 DNA‑10** — State save: `[timing, polarity, scale, pose, domain, conditioning, units, precision, cost, seed]`.
3. **G2 Octet** — Eight materially independent views (methods/regimes/slices).
4. **G3 Mirror** — Forward↔inverse (or swapped‑order) replay to palindromic rest.
5. **G4 Δ‑lift** — One local, monotone repair per failure; verify non‑regression.
6. **G5 Strict** — Tighten thresholds only after success.
7. **G6 Receipt** — Record OPE/FCE debt, votes, 4‑bit code, evidence hash (Merkle/page).

## Why 4/8/64? (quick intuition)

- **4 bits**: minimal, stable receipt; the n=4 hinge that forces an **octet** at n=5.
- **8 views**: the Octet overlay prevents narrow wins; forms the E8‑friendly symmetry scaffold.
- **64 lanes**: sidecars for domains; each runs the same gates (turn on/off as needed).

## Files you likely have (WHY series)

- `WHY_01...WHY_10` PDFs — “Why” booklets, each a worked example with receipts.
- `WHY_10_Final_Synthesis_CQE_Runbook.pdf` — The master runbook + printable templates.
- `CQE_Frontpage_Explainer.pdf`, `CQE_Helpsheet.pdf` — This pack’s 1‑pagers.
- *(Optional)* `forms/` — Fillable token cards, DNA‑10, Octet, Mirror, Δ‑lift, Strict, Receipts.

## Quickstart (15 minutes)

1. **Scope**: Write 6–12 stand‑in tokens with units and guard ranges.
2. **Octet**: Pick 8 non‑redundant views (methods/slices/regimes). Label them H1…H8.
3. **Mirror**: Define a reversible or swapped‑order test; set tolerances.
4. **Run**: Execute; if a view fails, apply **one** Δ‑lift; rerun non‑regression.
5. **Strict**: If it passes, tighten the bound; otherwise, annihilate and log breadcrumb.
6. **Receipt**: Record 4‑bit code, votes, debts, evidence hash. Bind semantics now.

## Color & marks

- **Gray**: Rest (palindromic mirror box)  
- **8 hues**: Octet views H1…H8  
- **Red**: Δ‑lift edits  
- **Gold**: Strict ratchet numbers  
- **Blue**: Receipts (votes, debts, hash)  
- **■■■■**: 4‑bit code (four tiny squares)

## Sidecars (examples; up to 64)

OPTICS · THERMAL · POLAR · EM_FIELD · SPINTRONICS_Q · BIO_COHERENCE · CHEM_KINETICS · GEO_FLUIDS ·
FIN_RISK · ROBOT_KIN · CONTROL · PLASMA · ACOUSTICS · COSMOS · INFO/THERMO · MATH/UNITS · STORAGE ·
SECURITY · DATA/ML · HCI · SAFETY · REGULATORY · TEST/RUNBOOK · … *(expand as needed)*

## Receipts (what to log)

- **OPE debt** (operational); **FCE debt** (formal/consistency)  
- **Mirror votes** (e.g., 22/24) and **view votes** (e.g., 46/64)  
- **Strict bounds** (before→after)  
- **Δ‑lift** summary (local, monotone; non‑regression passes)  
- **4‑bit code** (e.g., 1011) and **evidence hash**

## Safety and redaction

- Bind meaning only *after* commit.
- Redact field‑sensitive steps; keep receipts public (`Some results redacted for safety`). 
- Never bypass Mirror/Octet/Strict; geometry is the governor.

## FAQ (short)

- **Do I always need all 64 sidecars?** No. Turn on the few that matter; others can stay idle.  
- **Is 8 fixed?** Yes for coverage minimality in this system; fewer views risk blind spots.  
- **What if I need more than one Δ‑lift?** That becomes a new run. Keep each lift monotone and local.  
- **Why 4‑bit?** Minimal reproducible fingerprint that composes cleanly; promote to 8/64 if collisions appear.
